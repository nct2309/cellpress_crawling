## Highlights

    •Determined the structure of the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex bound to six potent antibodies•Pfs230: Pfs48/45 interaction via the C terminus of Pfs230 is not critical for transmission•Structurally delineated three previously undefined transmission-blocking epitopes•Potency of anti-Pfs230 mAbs is dependent on angle of approach relative to membrane

## Summary

    The Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex forms the basis for leading malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates, yet little is known about its molecular assembly. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structure of the endogenous Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex bound to six transmission-blocking antibodies. Our structure revealed that Pfs230 consists of multiple domain clusters rigidified by interactions mediated through insertion domains. Membrane-anchored Pfs48/45 formed a disk-like structure, interacting with a short C-terminal peptide on Pfs230 that was critical for Pfs230 membrane-retention in vivo. Membrane retention through this interaction was not essential for transmission to mosquitoes, suggesting that complex disruption is not a mode of action for transmission-blocking antibodies. Analyses of Pfs48/45- and Pfs230-targeted antibodies identified conserved epitopes on the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex and provided a structural paradigm for complement-dependent activity of Pfs230-targeting antibodies. Altogether, the antibody-bound Pfs230: Pfs48/45 structure improves our molecular understanding of this biological complex, informing the development of next-generation Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking interventions.

## Introduction

      Nearly half of the human population is at risk for malaria infection, making malaria one of the largest public health concerns. (Ref: 1) The parasite that is responsible for the majority of fatal human cases, Plasmodium falciparum, is efficiently transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes throughout the population. (Ref: 2) Human-to-mosquito transmission is mediated by mature male and female gametocytes that are taken up by an Anopheles mosquito during a bloodmeal. (Ref: 3) Inside the mosquito midgut, male and female gametocytes rapidly activate and egress from their red blood cells (RBCs) as micro- and macrogametes, respectively. Microgametes fuse with macrogametes, creating a zygote that forms the basis for further parasite development in the mosquito, eventually resulting in an infectious mosquito that can further spread the parasite and its related disease. (Ref: 4)
      Two sexual-stage surface proteins essential for Plasmodium transmission, Pfs230 (Ref: 5) and Pfs48/45, (Ref: 6) are expressed in both gametocytes and gametes. Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 knockout (KO) parasites showed markedly lower oocyst formation rates, demonstrating that these proteins play a critical role in establishing mosquito infection. (Ref: 7) (Ref: 8) Pfs48/45 is predicted to have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor and localizes together with Pfs230 to the parasite plasma membrane (PPM). (Ref: 9) Pfs230, without a recognizable GPI anchor or transmembrane motif, is thought to associate with the PPM by forming a stable heterodimeric complex with Pfs48/45. (Ref: 7) (Ref: 10) (Ref: 11) Both proteins are part of the 6-cysteine (6-Cys) protein family, characterized by the presence of 6-Cys domains: immunoglobulin-like folds that contain up to six cysteines that can form disulfide bonds. (Ref: 7) (Ref: 12) (Ref: 13) Pfs230 contains fourteen 6-Cys domains, whereas Pfs48/45 contains three (Figure 1A). Structural information on the full Pfs230: Pfs48/45 structure has been limited; two full-length structures of recombinant Pfs48/45 have been reported, adopting two distinct conformations (a disk-like (Ref: 14) and an extended (Ref: 15) conformation), whereas the structural characterization of Pfs230 has been limited to just the first two domains of the protein. (Ref: 16) (Ref: 17) (Ref: 18) (Ref: 19) (Ref: 20) Additionally, there is a lack of structural understanding of what domains are involved in the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 interaction itself.
      The developmental bottleneck formed by the human-to-mosquito transmission stages is an attractive target for interventions seeking malaria elimination, including transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs). (Ref: 21) Both Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 were recognized early on as the targets for antibodies that had potent human-to-mosquito transmission-reducing activity (TRA). (Ref: 9) (Ref: 11) (Ref: 22) Since then, multiple studies have shown that naturally infected individuals can acquire Pfs230- and Pfs48/45-targeting antibodies that are associated with high-level TRA in serum. (Ref: 23) (Ref: 24) (Ref: 25) (Ref: 26) (Ref: 27) (Ref: 28) The structure, epitopes, and TRA of these naturally acquired antibodies have been partially characterized at the monoclonal antibody (mAb) level. (Ref: 15) (Ref: 17) (Ref: 20) (Ref: 29) (Ref: 30) Domain 1 of Pfs230 (Pfs230D1) and domain 3 of Pfs48/45 (Pfs48/45D3) are the targets of the most potent transmission-blocking mAbs. (Ref: 15) (Ref: 17) (Ref: 19) (Ref: 20) (Ref: 29) (Ref: 29) (Ref: 31) (Ref: 32) (Ref: 33) Initial reports suggested that other domains of Pfs230 were not able to elicit comparably potent transmission-blocking antibodies. (Ref: 33) (Ref: 34) Recently, at least three other Pfs230 domains, and Pfs48/45D1, have been identified as targets for potent transmission-blocking antibodies, but structural insight into these epitopes is lacking in comparison to Pfs230D1 and Pfs48/45D3. (Ref: 29) (Ref: 35) (Ref: 36) (Ref: 37) (Ref: 38)
      Regardless of the domain they target, the vast majority of the potent α-Pfs230 antibodies is complement dependent. (Ref: 17) (Ref: 20) (Ref: 35) (Ref: 39) In contrast, α-Pfs48/45 antibodies can block transmission at low concentrations in a complement-independent manner. (Ref: 15) (Ref: 18) (Ref: 29) (Ref: 31) (Ref: 37) (Ref: 40) The rationale behind what drives antibody potency for both α-Pfs230 and α-Pfs48/45 antibodies remains unclear. As both proteins are capable of eliciting highly potent antibodies, they have been targeted as lead antigens (Ref: 30) (Ref: 41) and have been evaluated in phase 1/2 clinical trials. (Ref: 42) (Ref: 43) (Ref: 44) (Ref: 45) (Ref: 46) Although some of these clinical trials showed promising results, induced TRA was incomplete, and more efficacious vaccines may thus be needed. Structure-function relationships of how potent antibodies target the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex would not only enhance our understanding of P. falciparum transmission biology and antibody mechanisms of action but also aid in the design and development of next-generation malaria vaccines that can induce more potent TRA to reach elimination goals.
      Here, we report the molecular structure of the endogenous Pfs230: Pfs48/45 heterodimer in complex with six antibodies with potent TRA as determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Cumulatively, our data provide critical molecular insights into the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 heterodimer complex, moving toward deepening our understanding of P. falciparum transmission biology and opportunities to block this process through next-generation biomedical interventions.

## Results

### Cryo-EM structure of the Pfs230:Pfs48/45:6Fab complex

        We set out to determine the cryo-EM structure of the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex by purifying it from mature P. falciparum gametocytes. Using the inducible gametocyte-producing parasite line NF54/iGP2, (Ref: 47) we fused pfs230 (PlasmoDB: Pf3D7_0209000) C-terminally with a 3xFLAG-C-tag coding sequence, which yielded parasite line iGP2230-tag (Figures S1A–S1D). iGP2230-tag gametocytes showed normal Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 localization and retained normal in vitro exflagellation and mosquito infectivity in standard membrane feeding assays (SMFAs; Figures S1E and S1F). The Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex was purified using anti-FLAG resin. Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 were the most enriched proteins from this purification as detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Figures 1B–1D). Two high-molecular-weight bands were observed in blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) (Figure 1E). Both bands were stained by α-Pfs230 antibodies in immunoblotting assays, but only one band was stained by α-Pfs48/45 antibodies, attributing these two bands to the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex and Pfs230 alone, respectively (Figure 1F). BN-PAGE analysis of eluted protein incubated with a molar excess of different fragment antigen-binding (Fab) domains of transmission-blocking antibodies, targeting a range of conformational epitopes on Pfs48/45 and Pfs230, confirmed the native structure of the eluted proteins (Figure S1G).
        Since we were interested in how potent transmission-blocking antibodies are targeting the native Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex, we generated a size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-purified Pfs230: Pfs48/45 heterodimer in complex with six Fab fragments, using the structurally delineated RUPA-97, (Ref: 20) LMIV230-01, (Ref: 19) and RUPA-44, (Ref: 29) and the non-delineated 2A2, (Ref: 37) (Ref: 39) (Ref: 48) 18F25, (Ref: 35) (Ref: 48) and RUPA-71 (Ref: 29) antibodies (Figures 1G and S1H). Cryo-EM data of this Pfs230: Pfs48/45:6Fab complex was collected at 0°, 35°, and 40° tilt. 2D class averages from this dataset clearly revealed the presence of all components of the complex: Pfs230 bound to four Fabs (RUPA-97, LMIV230-01, 2A2, and 18F25) in complex with Pfs48/45 bound to two Fabs (RUPA-71 and RUPA-44) (Figure 1H). The highest resolution structural information was derived by generating four locally refined maps corresponding to more rigid components of the complex: Pfs230D1–6 bound to RUPA-97, LMIV230-01, and 2A2 at a global resolution of 3.6 Å; Pfs230D7–8 bound to 18F25 at a global resolution of 4.3 Å; Pfs230D9–14 bound to Pfs48/45 at a global resolution of 4.7 Å; and Pfs48/45 bound to Pfs230D13–14, RUPA-71, and RUPA-44 at a global resolution of 3.4 Å (Figures 1I, 1J, S1I, and S2; Table 1).

### Insertion domains (IDs) organize Pfs230 domains

        Molecular models were built into each of the locally refined maps to elucidate the structural features of the interdomain topologies and dispositions of potent mAbs. The models derived from the maps of Pfs230D1–6: RUPA-97: LMIV230-01:2A2 and Pfs230D7–8:18F25 (Figures 1I and 1J; Table 1) were initialized from experimentally determined crystal structures and predicted AlphaFold (AF) models, which were refined into the maps with sufficiently high resolution to model some sidechain positions (Tables 1 and S3). For the 4.7 Å resolution map of Pfs230D9–14: Pfs48/45, we report the backbone positions of a compositely refined Pfs230D9–12 structure in the presence of the Pfs230D13–14: Pfs48/45 structure discerned from the 3.4 Å resolution map (Figures 1I and 1J; Table 1). AF models of Pfs230D9–D12 were docked and manually rearranged into the Pfs230D9-14: Pfs48/45 map. A template-guided inference strategy in AF2 followed by refinement using map-constrained energy minimizations resulted in the final model. We attribute the lower local resolution of Pfs230D9–12 in our Pfs48/45: Pfs230D9–14 map to intrinsic flexibility between the D12 and D13 domains, enhanced by the complexed α-Pfs48/45 antibodies that may create steric hindrance in this region.
        Each tandem structural unit of Pfs230 consists of A- and B-type 6-Cys domains (Figure S3). Most A-type domains feature a 5-on-5 β-sandwich, whereas B-type domains feature a 4-on-5 β-sandwich fold (Figure S3A, inset). A key differentiating feature of these folds isthe way in which the first two β-strands are arranged (Figures 2A and S3A, inset). In the A-type folds (i. e., Pfs230 D1, D3, D5, D7, D9, D11, and D13), the first canonical β1 strand is split between the two β sheets (β1 and β1′) of the 6-Cys β-sandwich fold before transitioning into the β2 strand. In contrast, in the B-type folds (i. e., Pfs230 D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D14), the first two β strands (β1 and β2) are part of the same β sheet.
        While small deviations from the canonical 6-Cys domains were found, primarily near the perpendicular β-hairpin (Figures S3B and S3C), most of the structural diversity that distinguished the different Pfs230 6-Cys domains lay in long sequence insertions in loop regions between the β-strands (Figure 2A). These regions were previously coined as insertion domains (IDs) for another 6-Cys domain-containing protein (Ref: 49) (Ref: 50) and were found to be present in Pfs230D3, D6, D7, D10, and D11 (Figures S3D–S3I). Many of these IDs (i. e., Pfs230D3, D6, D10, and D11-ID2) contributed to interdomain contacts (Figures 2B and 2C), while others (i. e., Pfs230D11-ID1 and D7) did not interact with other domains (Figures 2C, S3H, and S3I). The presence of these IDs mediates the formation of rigid domain clusters in Pfs230.

### The Pfs230 C terminus interacts with Pfs48/45

        The interaction site between Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 was delineated at 3.4 Å resolution (Figures 3A, S2D, and S4A–S4C; Table 1). Our structure indicated that Pfs230 engages with all three domains of Pfs48/45 through its terminal 6-Cys domains, Pfs230D13 (326 Å2) and Pfs230D14 (1,477 Å2) (Figure 3B). The map density is congruent with Pfs48/45 adopting a disk-like conformation in our structure when bound to Pfs230, with Pfs48/45D1 (1,217 Å2) and Pfs48/45D3 (465 Å2) accounting for the majority of contacts with Pfs230, with Pfs48/45D2 (129 Å2) contributing more modestly (Figures 3B, S4D, and S4E; Table S2). Pfs230 binds to Pfs48/45 on the opposite face of the disk conformation compared with the C terminus of Pfs48/45, where the GPI linker is located for attachment to the PPM (Figure 3B). Previously, two different conformations of Pfs48/45 have been observed in the absence of Pfs230 binding: a compact, disk-like structure solved using X-ray crystallography, (Ref: 14) and an elongated Pfs48/45 structure determined by cryo-EM as bound to a different set of antibodies. (Ref: 15) A comparison of these models with our Pfs230-bound Pfs48/45 structure indicated very similar arrangements of Pfs48/45D1–2 (backbone root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] = 1.4–1.7 Å for residues 45–288) (Figure S4E). However, the position of Pfs48/45D3 relative to Pfs48/45D1–2 varied considerably more. When aligned to Pfs48/45D1–2, no overlap was observed between Pfs48/45D3 from Pfs230-bound Pfs48/45 and the elongated Pfs48/45 structure. In contrast, more modest positional differences were observed between Pfs48/45D3 of the two disk-like Pfs48/45 structures (backbone RMSD = 3.9 Å for residues 291–426; Figure S4E).
        The C terminus of Pfs230 (Pfs230Cterm; residues 3,107–3,122)—a sequence extending out of the canonical 6-Cys domain—is integral for mediating the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 interaction (Figures 3C and S4A). These residues occupy a groove of the Pfs48/45 disk and form extensive interactions with residues 45–48 and 65–75 of Pfs48/45D1, loop 245–248 of Pfs48/45D2, and residues 371–374 and 379–380 of Pfs48/45D3 (Figures 3B and 3C). While accounting for fewer interactions than Pfs230D14, Pfs230D13 residues 2,868–2,871, and the intervening loop between Pfs230D13 and Pfs230D14 (residues 2,977–2,982) mediate complexation by engaging with a portion of a Pfs48/45D3 extended loop (residues 354–371) (Figure 3D). Additionally, we found that the Pfs48/45 N terminus wraps around Pfs48/45D1–2, and through residues 38–50, forms interactions with loops 2,993–2,998 and 3,107–3,116 and strand 3,011–3,013 of Pfs230D14 (Figures 3B and 3C). While the N-terminal region of Pfs48/45 remained largely unresolved in previous structural studies of Pfs48/45 without Pfs230, (Ref: 14) (Ref: 15) implying flexibility, this region was well-resolved in the Pfs230-bound structure (Figure S4F). Our structure revealed that, unlike other A-type domains, Pfs48/45D1 features a different β1 orientation and connectivity (Figure S4F), localizing to the interface. An analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across P. falciparum revealed that the interface between Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 is highly conserved (Figures S4D and S4G).
        Corroborating these structural findings, a recombinantly produced protein construct spanning Pfs230D13-14-Cterm bound to female gametes on which Pfs48/45 is anchored, while similarly produced constructs spanning either Pfs230D1 or Pfs230D10 could not (Figure S5A). To further confirm the interaction between Pfs230D13-14-Cterm and Pfs48/45, two transgenic parasite lines carrying a truncated pfs230 gene were created (Figures S5B–S5E). Pfs230ΔD13/14 parasites express Pfs230 up until Pfs230D12, while Pfs230 expressed in Pfs230ΔCterm gametocytes only lack the last 29 C-terminal residues (residues 3,107–3,135), seen as central to the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 interface in our cryo-EM structure. Wild-type (WT) Pfs230 is expected to localize on the outside of the PPM, facing into the parasitophorous vacuole, and to co-localize with PPM-bound Pfs48/45. Western blot analysis showed that late-stage Pfs230ΔD13/14 and Pfs230ΔCterm gametocytes still contained (truncated) Pfs230. However, saponin-treated parasites with a disrupted parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) lost all Pfs230, demonstrating that Pfs230 is no longer retained on the PPM (Figures S5F and S5G). In fixed immunofluorescence microscopy, full-length and truncated Pfs230 proteins localized in close proximity to Pfs48/45, suggesting that Pfs230 protein trafficking is unaffected in both mutant parasite lines (Figure S5H). When the PVM was naturally disrupted upon activation of macrogametes or chemically disrupted in saponin-treated gametocytes, Pfs230 remained bound on the PPM surface in WT parasites. In contrast, both Pfs230ΔD13/14 and Pfs230ΔCterm gametocytes and gametes lacked surface-bound Pfs230 in these experiments (Figures 3E and 3F). We could not find evidence of a Pfs230-positive population in Pfs230ΔCterm gametes in a flow cytometry-based binding assay using over 2,000 macrogametes (Figures S5I and S5J). Together, our structural and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal region of Pfs230 is essential for the formation of the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex.

### RUPA-71 targets the highly conserved Pfs48/45D1-ii epitope

        The X-ray crystal structure of unliganded RUPA-71 was solved at 2.3 Å resolution (Table S3) to use as a high-resolution model to fit and refine into the 3.4 Å resolution Pfs230D13–14: Pfs48/45: RUPA-71: RUPA-44 cryo-EM map (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4B; Table 1). RUPA-71 is the second Pfs48/45D1 mAb to be structurally characterized, after the previously described mAb RUPA-58. (Ref: 15) Both mAbs, as well as other antibodies that compete with them, require low concentrations to inhibit in SMFAs (concentration needed to reach 80% TRA in SMFA [IC80] < 10 μg/mL), indicating that their binding sites are targeted by highly neutralizing antibodies. (Ref: 15) (Ref: 29) Our structure showed that RUPA-71 predominantly interacts with residues 126–135 of Pfs48/45D1, with additional contacts made with Pfs48/45D1 residues 33–36, 88–90, and 101–104 (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4B; Table S4). This is consistent with the previous epitope mapping derived from hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). (Ref: 15) Heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 1 (HCDR1; 99 Å2), HCDR2 (60 Å2), HCDR3 (443 Å2), and Kappa CDR1 (KCDR1; 29 Å2) of RUPA-71 all contact Pfs48/45D1, with the extended HCDR3 (20 amino acids [aa]) contributing most key contacts (Figure 4A; Table S4). The epitope of RUPA-71 is highly charged with several negative and positive patches. Our model revealed that RUPA-71 binds to these regions through salt bridges formed between RUPA-71 KCDR1 residue K32 and HCDR1-3 residues D31, D52C, and R98 and E129, K89, K101, E130, and D132 of Pfs48/45D1 (Figure 4A; Table S4). We found that the HCDR3 of RUPA-71 adopts a β-hairpin that forms a β sheet-like structure with β strands of Pfs48/45D1 (residues 126–143) (Figure 4B). In addition to intra-chain hydrogen bonds, this β sheet is held together by five backbone hydrogen bonds between RUPA-71 G96, R98, and Y100 and D132, E130, and I128 of Pfs48/45D1 (Figure 4B; Table S4). Notably, several residues within framework region 3 of the RUPA-71 kappa chain form contacts with four Pfs230 residues, K3000, L3003, D3007, and I3009 (Table S4). RUPA-71 can bind to Pfs48/45 and P48/45D1-2 constructs, indicating that these interactions are not required for binding but may provide additional stability. (Ref: 15) (Ref: 29) Sequence analysis across parasite field isolates revealed several very rare SNPs within the RUPA-71 epitope with allele frequencies of less than 0.06%: K33T/N, S36T, S90R, K101T, S119T, E129D, D132N, T133K/R, and P135T on Pfs48/45 and L3003S and D3007G on Pfs230, making it a well-conserved epitope (Figure S6A). (Ref: 51) When compared with RUPA-58, RUPA-71 binds to a largely separate epitope, with some overlap in residue contacts (K88, K89, S90, K101, E130, D132, and R140), which could result in steric clashes (Figure S6B). Together, these data indicate that this region of Pfs48/45D1 (residues 86–101 and 126–140) is associated with potent inhibition.

### Epitope 1a on Pfs48/45D3 is impeded in the Pfs230-bound state

        Next, we investigated how the Pfs230 interaction with Pfs48/45 might affect the accessibility of Pfs48/45-targeting antibodies. An overlay of structures of previously characterized antibodies with the Pfs230-bound structure revealed that Pfs48/45D1, Pfs48/45D2, and Pfs48/45D3-1b epitope antibodies approach from the side of the Pfs48/45 disk and are accessible when Pfs230 is bound (Figures S6C–S6E). In contrast, many antibodies that target the Pfs48/45D3-1a epitope, including highly potent antibodies TB31F and RUPA-29, would have considerable clashes with Pfs230D13–14 in this conformation (Figure 4C).
        To determine whether these antibodies can bind to Pfs48/45 in the context of the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex, we used BN-PAGE to study the changes in migratory pattern of Fab-bound Pfs230: Pfs48/45. To this end, the purified complex was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess Fab derived from a range of both potent and non-potent TRA antibodies, spanning almost all currently known epitopes on the complex. As expected, α-Pfs230 Fabs shifted both bands upward, with the exception of 15C5, which binds to an epitope inaccessible in full-length Pfs230 (Figure 4E). (Ref: 17) (Ref: 20) None of the other tested α-Pfs230 Fabs disrupted the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex, in agreement with the relative orientation of the targeted Pfs230 domains to Pfs48/45 in our structure. The α-Pfs48/45 Fabs did not shift the lower free Pfs230 band but did affect migration of the upper band. While some Fabs (1) bound to the intact complex (e. g., RUPA-44, RUPA-117), others (2) disrupted the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex (e. g., RUPA-58 and RUPA-50), or (3) showed a heterogeneous effect resulting in Fab-bound and unliganded Pfs230: Pfs48/45 (e. g., TB31F, RUPA-47) (Figure 4E). The non-potent 10D8, targeting Pfs48/45D2, could not bind to the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex. To confirm the observation that some but not all Pfs48/45-targeted antibodies could disrupt the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex, we tested whether a subset of these Fabs could displace Pfs230 on the female gamete surface in a competition assay. In agreement with the BN-PAGE results, RUPA-50, RUPA-57, and RUPA-58 substantially decreased Pfs230 on the gamete surface in a dose-dependent manner, while, e. g., TB31F, RUPA-46, and RUPA-89 Fabs showed no displacement of Pfs230 (Figure S6F).
        Despite possible steric clashes between TB31F and Pfs230, TB31F could still partially bind to the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex in BN-PAGE (Figure 4E) and did not displace Pfs230 on the gamete surface (Figure S6F). In this context, it is worth noting again that Pfs48/45 can adopt both a disk-like and a more elongated conformation. Given that Pfs48/45D1–2 contributes 1,346 Å2 of a total 1,811 Å2 buried surface area within the Pfs48/45-Pfs230 interface, it is conceivable that Pfs48/45D1–2 is sufficient for Pfs230 binding, allowing for Pfs48/45D3 to retain a range of motion in the complex. Overlaying Pfs48/45D3 antibodies onto the previously modeled extended conformation of Pfs48/45 with Pfs48/45D1–2: Pfs230D13–14 from our structure aligned to its Pfs48/45D1–2 demonstrated that the Pfs48/45D3-1a epitope would be accessible in this arrangement (Figure 4D). This elongated conformation could also accommodate binding for most anti-Pfs48/45 antibodies that target epitope 1b or Pfs48/45D1–2, with the exception of 10D8 (Figures 4D and S6G). (Ref: 14) (Ref: 15) Together, this could indicate that Pfs230-bound Pfs48/45 retains flexibility, and that this mobility may allow for the binding of antibodies that would otherwise be blocked in the Pfs230-bound disk-like conformation of Pfs48/45.

### Pfs230 membrane retention is non-essential for transmission

        The ability of Fab fragments to induce (partial) disruption of the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex did not seem to be associated with TRA of the corresponding antibody in SMFAs (Figures 4E and S6F; Table S1). For example, both RUPA-57 and RUPA-50 dissociated the complex in vitro and partially in vivo on the gamete surface but have very different potencies of IC80 > 100 μg/mL and IC80 < 2 μg/mL, respectively. To investigate whether Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex disruption could still be a mode of action for some transmission-blocking antibodies, we further characterized the Pfs230 truncation parasite lines. These parasite lines mimic the most severe outcome of antibody-induced complex dissociation, where all Pfs230 is dissociated from the PPM. Both Pfs230ΔD13/14 and Pfs230ΔCterm gametocytes showed high oocyst intensities in multiple independent membrane feeding experiments (Figure 4F; Table S5), in contrast to almost complete lack of oocysts previously reported for Pfs230KO parasite lines. (Ref: 7) Although our truncation lines showed lower oocyst intensity than WT parasites in some experiments, other experiments showed no difference. We confirmed by midgut oocyst genomic DNA extraction and PCR that the observed oocysts only contain mutant parasite DNA, ruling out accidental WT contaminations (Figure S5K). To further confirm that Pfs230 remains dissociated from the parasite surface within the mosquito midgut, we added the Pfs230D4-targeting antibody 2A2 into the bloodmeal with either WT NF54 or Pfs230ΔCterm gametocytes. While 2A2 almost completely blocked transmission for WT parasites at 10 μg/mL (TRA 99.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 98.5– 99.4]), we observed no significant TRA for Pfs230ΔCterm gametocytes (TRA 13.0% [95% CI: −5.7 to 28.4]) (Figures 4G and S5L). Together, these data indicate that Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex disruption is not the mode of action for functional transmission-blocking α-Pfs48/45 (or α-Pfs230) antibodies.

### Potent Pfs230D4 and D7 epitopes exhibit high and low degrees of sequence diversity, respectively

        Our cryo-EM studies revealed potent epitopes outside of Pfs230D1 that had not been previously structurally delineated. 2A2 could be resolved in the Pfs230D1–6 map, while 18F25 could be resolved in the Pfs230D7–8 map (Figures 1I, S7A, and S7B; Table 1). X-ray crystal structures of unliganded 2A2 and 18F25 Fabs were solved to 1.2 and 1.6 Å resolution, respectively, (Table S3) and docked and refined into the maps. Our cryo-EM structure revealed that 2A2 targets Pfs230D4 (Figure 5A), as previously proposed. (Ref: 37) 2A2 buries 824 Å2 on Pfs230D4, primarily making contacts through the KCDR3 and all HCDR loops (Figure 5A; Table S4). Most residues contacted by the antibody lay in the canonical perpendicular β-hairpin of Pfs230D4 (β6-β7) and surrounding regions (β2-β4 regions) (Table S4). A moderate number of additional contacts are facilitated by the KCDR1/3 within the loop region between the β10 and β11 strands (Table S4). Analysis of the MalariaGEN Pf7 database revealed that many SNPs differing from the NF54 strain are found in the 2A2 epitope (Figure 5B). Some of the SNPs are quite rare with frequencies less than 1%, while others are seemingly more common (H1159D, 53.3%; Y1194S, 59.3%; N1209H, 19.2%; Q1250K, 86.3%; Q1250E, 12.6%).
        A subset (H1159D, Y1194S, Q1196E, N1209Y, and Q1250K) of these SNPs are in strains of P. falciparum in which 2A2 has diminished TRA and perturbed binding to live female gametes (Figure 5B). (Ref: 37) Two mutations (Y1194S and Q1250K) are both present in the NF135 and NF183 strains but are not sufficient to perturb the binding of 2A2 (Figure 5B). In contrast, strains NF149, NF175, and NF176 carry one to three additional SNPs, which we observed in the 2A2 epitope (H1159D, Q1196E, and N1209Y) that abolish 2A2 binding (Figure 5B). (Ref: 37)
        Our structure showed that the epitope of mAb 18F25 localizes to Pfs230D7 (Figure 5C). (Ref: 36) Integrative modeling in the 4.3 Å global-resolution map suggested that 18F25 buries 550 Å2 on Pfs230D7 through all CDRs of the antibody (Table S4). 18F25 was observed to primarily engage with the Pfs230D7-ID found between β4 and β5, with a small number of interactions localized to the β8-β9 loop (Figure 5C; Table S4). Unlike the 2A2 epitope and Pfs230D4 overall, both the 18F25 epitope and Pfs230D7 are more conserved (Figure 5D). Only two SNPs in Pfs230D7 in the MalariaGEN Pf7 database have frequencies higher than 10% (Y1829N, 69.4% and I1870V, 13.5%), (Ref: 51) and these are not contained within the 18F25 epitope. Only two SNPs within the 18F25 epitope are reported, D1803N (0.01%) and N1804D (0.2%), both being conservative mutations that occur relatively infrequently.
        To better understand how the SNPs found in the 18F25 epitope affect the affinity of the mAb to Pfs230D7, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments (Figure 5D), using Pfs230D7 constructs expressed in a wheat germ cell-free protein expression system. (Ref: 52) In addition to the D1803N and N1804D SNPs, V1801I/V1801L/V1801A (5.7%, 0.01%, and 0.09% frequencies, respectively) were also tested as they lay near the epitope and are found more frequently. SPR experiments utilizing the 18F25 Fab and WT Pfs230D7 revealed that the antibody binds to its native epitope with single-digit nanomolar affinity (KD = 1.8 nM). Mutation of the most polymorphic residue, V1801, to the three different SNPs revealed a negligible effect on binding affinity, with Fab 18F25 maintaining WT-level nanomolar binding affinity (V1801A, KD = 3.6 nM; V1801L, KD = 2.6 nM; and V1801I, 0.9 nM, respectively). While the rarer SNPs D1803N and N1804D had a more moderate effect (KD = 181 nM and KD = 92 nM, respectively), nanomolar-level binding affinity was still maintained. Together, our data elucidate the non-conserved 2A2 and highly conserved 18F25 epitopes on Pfs230D4 and D7, respectively, providing structural insights into Pfs230-directed antibody responses outside of Pfs230D1.

### Potent Pfs230 antibodies target membrane distal epitopes

        2A2, while showing strain-dependent TRA, is highly potent in SMFAs utilizing the NF54 strain (IC80 = 1.9 μg/mL). (Ref: 37) The potency is on par with the highly potent RUPA-97 that targets Pfs230D1 (IC80 = 0.7 μg/mL (Ref: 20)), suggesting that a common feature of these mAbs might be responsible for their high potencies. Our structures revealed that these two mAbs, despite binding different domains, bind to the same side of Pfs230 with a similar angle of approach (Figure 6A). Similarly, 18F25 (IC80 < 30 μg/mL (Ref: 36)) also binds to the same face of Pfs230, while differing slightly in its angle of approach (Figure 6A). In contrast, Pfs230D1-directed mAbs of lower potency, such as RUPA-38 (IC80 > 100 μg/mL (Ref: 20)), bind to the opposite face of where RUPA-97, 2A2, and 18F25 bind to Pfs230 (Figure 6A). This trend was found to be generally applicable to α-Pfs230D1 mAbs published to date (Figures S7C–S7F). (Ref: 17)
        Pfs230-targeting mAbs are largely complement dependent. (Ref: 20) (Ref: 35) (Ref: 36) (Ref: 37) (Ref: 39) To activate complement, immunoglobulins G (IgGs) need to assemble into ordered hexameric antibody structures to efficiently recruit C1q, an essential step in the classical complement activation pathway. (Ref: 53) (Ref: 54) Since the epitopes of non-potent mAbs contrast with the potent ones in that they face toward Pfs48/45, and therefore the PPM, we hypothesized that the angle of approach of the antibody is a determinant of Pfs230-directed antibody potency: antibodies that are near the PPM might be prevented from efficient recruitment of complement components. To test this hypothesis, we selected five different mAbs targeting Pfs230D1 with different potencies (RUPA-97 [IC80 = 0.7 μg/mL], rh4F12 [IC80 = 55 μg/mL], LMIV230-01 [IC80 = 48 μg/mL], RUPA-38 [IC80 > 100 μg/mL]), and LMIV230-02 (IC80 > 1,000 μg/mL), (Ref: 19) (Ref: 20) expressed these mAbs as IgGs of the same complement-fixing subclass, tested antibody binding to female gametes, and measured mAb-mediated C1q or C3 deposition on live female NF54 gametes. All antibodies except LMIV230-02 bound gametes with similar intensity (Figure 6B), which is in agreement with previously determined in vitro affinities. (Ref: 20) In contrast, the highly potent antibody RUPA-97 and moderately potent antibodies rh4F12 and LMIV230-01 were able to recruit C1q and deposit C3 on the surface, while the non-potent RUPA-38 was not able to do so efficiently (Figures 6C and 6D). These findings, as implied by the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex structure, suggest that the angle of approach relative to the PPM may be a critical determinant for potency in complement-dependent Pfs230-directed antibodies.

## Discussion

      Targeting human-to-mosquito transmission, a developmental bottleneck in the Plasmodium life cycle, is a promising intervention strategy for malaria control and elimination. Here, we revealed the structural disposition of the heterodimeric complex of Pfs230: Pfs48/45, which is essential for P. falciparum transmission and forms a major target for malaria TBV development. Our structure revealed how IDs present within Pfs230 6-Cys domains mediate interdomain interactions as seen with the Pf12: Pf41 heterodimer complex, which are two other malarial proteins that are composed of 6-Cys domains. (Ref: 49) (Ref: 50) Additionally, inter-protein contacts between Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 appear to be mediated by regions outside of the canonical 6-Cys fold; we have shown how the C-terminal extension of Pfs230 is critical for binding, and observed that the N-terminal extension of Pfs48/45 is also localized to this interface. This suggests that regions outside of the canonical 6-Cys fold may have been introduced to provide functional roles by mediating interactions, which could be a generalizable property of the 6-Cys domain family of proteins.
      Although it is currently unknown what exact cellular process the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex is involved in, KO studies in P. falciparum and the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei suggest the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex is involved in microgamete-to-macrogamete adhesion and microgamete-to-RBC adhesion resulting in exflagellation centers. (Ref: 7) (Ref: 8) (Ref: 55) The presented structure will enable the design of domain clusters with more precision than previously possible for the generation of genetically modified parasite lines that can interrogate Pfs230 function. Our structure also showed that the N-terminal domains are membrane distal, potentially allowing interactions with other elements. This is in line with previous descriptions of some functional complement-independent α-Pfs230D1 antibodies, suggesting that Pfs230D1 might be involved in some protein interactions that are disrupted upon binding of these antibodies. (Ref: 16) (Ref: 32) Furthermore, recombinant Pfs230Pro-D1-D2 inhibits the formation of exflagellation centers, (Ref: 16) further suggesting that the N terminus of Pfs230 might be involved in cell-to-cell adhesion. Here, we observed that the C-terminal Pfs230 domains are involved in the Pfs48/45-based membrane anchoring onto the PPM. We showed that functional activity of complement-independent Pfs48/45 antibodies did not correlate with their ability to disrupt the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex. The transgenic parasite lines expressing truncated Pfs230, which lose Pfs230 membrane retention but are able to efficiently infect Anopheles mosquitoes, fully support the notion that complex dissociation is not a mode of action for transmission-blocking antibodies. These observations imply that Pfs48/45 does not merely serve as an anchor for Pfs230 membrane retention but carries out an additional critical function during parasite transmission that anti-Pfs48/45 antibodies can potently inhibit. There is a stark difference between the truncation parasite lines Pfs230ΔD13/14 and Pfs230ΔCterm that did infect mosquitoes, and the reported Pfs230KO parasite lines that almost completely lost the capability for parasite transmission. (Ref: 7) Future studies should focus on uncovering the roles of individual domains of Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 during parasite transmission.
      Next to characterizing the full-length structure of the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 heterodimer, we also molecularly characterized the epitopes of multiple transmission-blocking antibodies. The potent Pfs48/45D1-directed antibody, RUPA-71, binds an adjacent epitope to the previously characterized mAb, RUPA-58. (Ref: 15) All highly potent Pfs48/45D1 antibodies compete with either RUPA-58 or RUPA-71, indicating that binding to this conserved portion of Pfs48/45D1 is associated with TRA. Additionally, we structurally characterized potent epitopes outside of Pfs230D1 found on Pfs230D4 and Pfs230D7 targeted by 2A2 and 18F25, respectively. While 2A2 is notably potent when used against the NF54 strain, the epitope is highly polymorphic with many Pfs230D4 SNPs observed in field isolates. (Ref: 37) (Ref: 51) In contrast, both Pfs230D7 and the 18F25 epitope were highly conserved and may represent a yet unexplored opportunity for subunit vaccine development. Crucially, the few naturally occurring SNPs found in the 18F25 epitope were non-detrimental for antibody binding in vitro. In comparison to 2A2 and highly potent Pfs230D1-I binders, however, 18F25 exhibits approximately 10-fold lower potency. The ability to design Pfs230 probes based on the full-length structure will now enable discovery efforts seeking more potent antibodies. In addition, the structure of the full Pfs230: Pfs48/45 heterodimer complex reported here with structure-function relationships of antibody inhibition, now enables a more fulsome opportunity for structure-guided immunogen design, which has been transformative in vaccinology during the development of, e. g., SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines. (Ref: 56) (Ref: 57)
      Immunogens based on Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 have already shown promising results in clinical trials, (Ref: 42) (Ref: 43) (Ref: 44) (Ref: 58) though the induced inhibitory activity was incomplete and the durability of the response remains uncertain. Our findings suggest that current TBV candidates can be further optimized, for example, by including Pfs230 domains that were previously thought to be unable to induce functional transmission-blocking antibodies (Ref: 35) (Ref: 36) (Ref: 37) or by rational structure-based immunogen design. (Ref: 59) (Ref: 60) To date, most Pfs48/45-based interventions focus on Pfs48/45D3, but Pfs48/45D1 epitopes may be beneficial inclusions into future Pfs48/45-based immunogens. Currently, in the case of Pfs230 domains, Pfs230D1, D4, D7, and D12 have been demonstrated to elicit potent antibodies. (Ref: 20) (Ref: 35) (Ref: 36) (Ref: 37) These Pfs230 domains share a common feature in that they are membrane distal, suggesting that domains present on this side should be prioritized for subunit vaccine development. By this logic, Pfs230D8 and D9 may also be relevant targets. Future immunogen design efforts should integrate interdomain structural elements to present well-folded epitopes. Approaching immunogen design through stabilizing structural clusters, guided by the structure reported here, instead of individual domains, will help eliminate the presentation of non-neutralizing epitopes that are absent endogenously, as previously seen by the elicitation of Pfs230D1-binIII (15C5, LMIV230-02, and 230AS-26) and 230AL-20 mAbs by a Pfs230D1-only antigen. The presented Pfs230: Pfs48/45 structure might also allow for future protein engineering campaigns that graft multiple potent epitopes onto a single chimeric immunogen (Ref: 61) or use stabilizing mutations in conjunction with display on nanocages. (Ref: 62) Additionally, advances in mRNA vaccination approaches combined with precise immunogen design might allow for the in situ expression of stable, native Pfs230: Pfs48/45 co-assemblies. Ultimately, the aim will be to create the most potent next-generation TBVs possible to aid in meeting the ambitious goals of malaria elimination and eradication.

### Limitations of the study

        A limitation of our structure is the low resolution obtained for the Pfs230D9-12 domains (global resolution of 4.7 Å). This prevented building an atomic model for these domains, limiting the information that could be confidently extracted from this part of the map. Instead, we combined this low-resolution map with an AF-based modeling approach to obtain a backbone model with reasonable confidence regarding the domain orientations in this region of Pfs230. Additionally, while the presence of 2A2 does not seem to affect the overall structure of Pfs230: Pfs48/45 substantially, other antibodies in our structure could have potentially altered the structure of Pfs230: Pfs48/45 compared with its unliganded state. An unliganded Pfs230: Pfs48/45 heterodimer structure reported by others in parallel to our study described a similar overall structure for the heterodimer complex, indicating that antibody binding in our structure did not have a large effect. (Ref: 63) One notable difference in the 6Fab-bound Pfs230: Pfs48/45 structure compared with the unliganded structure is the increased flexibility within the Pfs230D9–14 region, specifically between Pfs230D12 and D13. In 2D classes of the full complex, the constant region of anti-Pfs48/45 Fab, RUPA-71, appeared to be in proximity to the Pfs230D1–6 and Pfs230D7–8 clusters of the molecule, potentially causing steric hindrance and necessitating accommodation of the Fab by changes in the D9–D12 cluster. We propose that this steric hindrance induced by RUPA-71 binding decompresses the Pfs230D9–12 cluster, resulting in a more dynamic disposition, and, consequently, poorer resolution of this portion of the map. Finally, we purified the Pfs230: Pfs48/45 from late-stage gametocytes instead of gametes, for practical reasons. However, during gamete formation the Pro-domain of Pfs230 is proteolytically cleaved, (Ref: 64) and therefore our structure does not fully recapitulate the mature protein species on gamete surfaces. How these additional Pro-domain residues add onto the structure and whether these influence the overall Pfs230: Pfs48/45 conformation, remains currently unknown.

### Experimental models and study participant details

#### Plasmodium falciparum culturing

          P. falciparum cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 3% O2 and 4% CO2, in complete medium (RPMI1640 medium with 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaHCO3, 10% human type A serum) with 5% O+ human red blood cells (Sanquin, The Netherlands). (Ref: 89) Asexual NF54/iGP2 and NF54/iGP2230-tag parasites were cultured in the presence of 2.5 mM D-(+)-glucosamine hydrochloride (Sigma #1514). Parasites were synchronized using sorbitol treatment before transfection or gametocyte induction. (Ref: 90)
          To induce gametocytogenesis, a 1% early trophozoite culture (±24 hours post invasion) was induced with AlbuMAX medium (RPMI1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 0.5% AlbuMAX-II (Gibco, #11021-045)), in a previously described automatic shaker setup with media changes every 12 h. (Ref: 91) (Ref: 92) Additionally, glucosamine was removed from iGP2-based cultures to further increase gametocyte induction. 36 h post induction until completion, cultures were maintained in complete medium. From day 4 – 8 post induction, gametocytes were cultured in the presence of 20 units/ml heparin (Sigma, #H3393) to eliminate asexual parasite growth. To obtain late-stage gametocyte saponin pellets, gametocytes were harvested on day 13 post induction by incubating the cells for 10 min in a 10x pellet volume ice-cold 0.06% (w/v) saponin in PBS supplemented with 1x Complete™ Protease Inhibitor (PI) Cocktail (Roche), and subsequent centrifugation at 3,000xg for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed three times in ice-cold PBS with 1x PI, flash frozen and stored at -70 °C.
          For transfection, 80 μg of homology directed repair (HDR) template plasmid was linearized overnight, ethanol precipitated and co-transfected with 80 μg of Cas9 guide plasmid by ring-stage transfection as described previously. (Ref: 93) (Ref: 94) Briefly, plasmids were resuspended in cytomix (10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 pH 7.6, 120 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA) and added to a 3% ring-stage NF54/iGP2 (to generate iGP2230-tag) or NF54 (to generate Pfs230ΔD13/D14 / Pfs230ΔCterm) culture. Parasites were electroporated (310 V, 950 μF), allowed to recover for 4 h, after which transfected parasites were selected using 2.5 nM WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceuticals) for five days. To obtain single-cell clones for iGP2230-tag, late-stage parasites were stained using 1 μg/ml Rhodamine123 solution, and single-cell sorted using a FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) in a round-bottom 96 well plate containing 100 μl complete medium with 3% haematocrit. To obtain an isogenic population for Pfs230ΔD13/D14 and Pfs230ΔCterm, parasites were sorted based on mScarlet expression using a Cytoflex SRT Benchtop Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter). Successful integration was confirmed by diagnostic PCR (Table S6).

#### Human cell line culture

          HEK 293F cells (human female cell line, FreeStyle™ 293-F cells, ThermoFisher) or HEK 293S cells (human female cell line, ThermoFisher) were used for recombinant protein expression. Cells were cultured in GIBCO™ FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (ThermoFisher) at 37 °C, with 70% humidity and 8% CO2 while rotating at 150 RPM. The cell line was not further authenticated; it was used for expression of mAbs and Fabs purified to high purity.

#### Insect cell line culture

          Pfs230 fragments were expressed in male Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells (ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies, Denmark), that were transfected according to manufacturer’s instruction to generate stable polyclonal cell lines. Cells were cultured using EX-CELL420 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at 25°C while shaking at 115 RPM. This cell line was not further authenticated, the identity of expressed proteins was confirmed.

### Method details

#### Plasmid construction

          To create the Cas9 guide plasmids, a pair of complementary guide-encoding oligonucleotides 5’- TTAATGATGGCTCTTGATTG-3’ (targeting Pfs230 C-terminus to create iGP2230-tag / Pfs230ΔD13/D14 / Pfs230ΔCterm) and 5’-ATTCTATTACATTATCAAGA-3’ (targeting Pfs230D13 to create Pfs230ΔD13/14) were treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed, and ligated into BbsI-digested pMLB626 (a kind gift from Marcus Lee). (Ref: 71)
          To generate the iGP2230-tag HDR template, partial 5’ and full 3’ homology regions (HR) were PCR amplified from NF54 genomic DNA (Table S6). Synonymous mutations to shield the Cas9 guide region in the full 5’HR were inserted by overlap PCR using the partial 5’HR and two annealed custom-made oligonucleotides (Sigma-Aldrich, Table S6). A selection cassette containing the i) PfH2B promoter, ii) the mScarlet gene, and iii) a bidirectional 3’UTR (PBANKA_142660) was PCR amplified from an in-house plasmid (Ref: 95) as two separate amplicons to remove internal restriction sites. These two amplicons were cloned into pGGASelect using a BsaI-HFv2 Golden Gate reaction, and further sub-cloned using AatII and BamHI-HF into a pUC19-based plasmid that had all internal type IIS restriction enzymes removed via site-directed mutagenesis, yielding pRF0508. The final HDR template was created using the NEBridge Golden Gate Assembly Kit (BsmBI-v2), combining i) pGGAselect, ii) the 5’ HR amplicon, iii) two annealed oligonucleotides coding for a tandem affinity purification tag (GTSG-(3xFLAG)-GSG-EPEA-stop) (Table S6), iv) pRF0508, and v) the 3’ HR amplicon.
          To generate HDR templates to make Pfs230ΔD13/14 and Pfs230ΔCterm, the respective 5’HRs (Pfs230ΔD13/14 spanning Pfs230D11-12, Pfs230ΔCterm spanning Pfs230D13-14) and 3’HR were PCR amplified from NF54 genomic DNA (Table S6). The selection cassette was modified by swapping the PfH2B promoter in pRF0508 for the PfGAPDH promoter (PlasmoDB: Pf3D7_1462800). The HDR templates were created in a golden gate reaction combining i) pGGAselect, ii) respective 5’HR amplicon, iii) PCR amplicon coding for (GGSG-3xFLAG-stop), iv) GAPDH selection marker, and v) the 3’ HR amplicon.
          All PCR reactions were performed using Primestar® GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio), all other cloning enzymes were obtained via New England Biolabs. Sequences were confirmed by Sanger Sequencing (Baseclear).

#### Western blot

          Saponin pellets from late-stage gametocyte cultures were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 1x PI) for 15 min at RT. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and supernatant was supplemented with 1x NuPAGE LDS buffer, and heated to 56 °C for 15 min. Samples were loaded on 4-12% bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (SurePAGE), using Precision Plus Dual Color (BioRad) as a reference. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to 0.45 μm Immun-Blot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in PBS with 3% BSA, before incubation with primary antibody diluted in PBS-T with 1% BSA. The following primary antibodies were used: 18F25 (mouse anti-Pfs230, (Ref: 48) 5 μg/ml), 32F3 (mouse anti-Pfs48/45, (Ref: 22) 5 μg/ml), M2 (mouse anti-FLAG, F1804 Sigma, 1:2000), CaptureSelect™ (biotinylated single domain antibody fragment anti-C-tag, Thermofisher, 1:1000). After washing, blots were incubated with one of the following secondary antibodies: HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (P0260, Dako, 1:2000), HRP-conjugated streptavidin (890803, R&D Systems, 1:500). Blots were developed with Clarity Western ECL substrate (BioRad) and imaged on an ImageQuant™ LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare).

#### Immunofluorescence microscopy

          Heparin-treated stage V gametocytes (day 13) were fixed (4% EM-grade paraformaldehyde, 0.0075% glutaraldehyde in PBS) for 20 min on pre-warmed poly-L-lysine coated coverslips at 37 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, washed in PBS and blocked using 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Primary and secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at RT, with PBS washes in between. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS, and included M2 (mouse anti-FLAG, F1804 (Sigma), 1:500), RUPA-55 mAb (human anti-Pfs230, (Ref: 20) 5 μg/ml), and 85RF45.1 mAb (rat anti-Pfs48/45, (Ref: 66) 5 μg/ml). Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse 594 (A11005), goat anti-human 488 (A11013), and chicken anti-rat 647 (A21472) (ThermoFisher)) were all diluted 1:500 in PBS with 1 μM DAPI. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield® Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM900 Airyscan confocal microscope using a 63x oil objective with 405, 488, 561, and 633 nm laser excitation and an Electronically Switchable Illumination and Detection Model (ESID) for transmitted light.

#### Suspension immunofluorescence assays

          For gamete SIFAs, heparin-treated stage V gametocytes (day 13 post-induction) were collected, spun down to remove the culture medium, and resuspended in half the culture volume of FCS. After incubation with gentle agitation at RT for 1 h, parasites were spun down and washed in ice-cold PBS. For saponin-treated gametocytes, heparin-treated stage V gametocytes (day 13 post-induction) were collected, spun down, and resuspended in half the volume of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.06% Saponin and 1x protease inhibitor. After 10 min incubation on ice, saponin-treated gametocytes were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold SIFA buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5% FCS). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C.
          Both gametes and gametocytes were incubated for 1 h in SIFA buffer with 15 μg/ml mAb 18F25 or 85RF45.1, labeled with LYNX Rapid Plus DyLight488 Antibody Conjugation Kit (Bio-Rad). After washing in ice-cold SIFA buffer, parasites were resuspended in ice-cold PBS and deposited in pre-cooled poly-L-lysin-coated μ-slide 8 well Ibidi chambers. Parasites were allowed to settle at 4 °C, after which the Ibidi chamber was transferred to a room-temperature Axio Observer 7 Inverted LED microscope equipped with a Colibri 7 LED source and Axiocam 705 mono (Zeiss). Images were taken with a 63x oil objective using the 475 nm LED module and a Differential Interference Contrast enhanced brightfield channel.

#### Exflagellation assay and mosquito infections

          Day 15 cultures of non-heparin treated gametocytes were used to test exflagellation. Cultures were mixed 1:1 with 50 μM xanthurenic acid in complete media, and incubated at room temperature in a dark, humid chamber for 15 min. The number of exflagellation centres per ml was determined by bright-field microscopy using a Neubauer chamber. To assess mosquito infectivity, day 15 non-heparin treated gametocytes were added to the bloodmeal of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (colony maintained at Radboudumc (Nijmegen, The Netherlands)), as described previously. (Ref: 96) In the SMFA experiments with 2A2, purified 2A2.2a IgG was diluted in FBS to a final concentration within the total bloodmeal of 10 μg/ml, and mixed with mature P. falciparum gametocytes and human serum that contains active complement. Mosquito midguts from 20 mosquitoes were dissected 6-8 days after the blood meal, stained with mercurochrome, and oocysts were counted by microscopy. Raw oocyst numbers are found in Table S7.

#### Purification of Pfs230:Pfs48/45 complex

          Frozen stage V gametocyte pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1x PI, and 0.25% (v/v) DDM), and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 18,000xg at 4 °C for 30 min, after which the pellet was solubilized a second time following the previous steps. The combined supernatants were applied to anti-FLAG® M2 affinity resin (Merck), and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was extensively washed in Wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1x PI, and 0.02% DDM), after which proteins were eluted using 5x resin volume of elution buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl) supplemented with 0.02% DDM, and 150 μg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Merck)). For cryo-EM studies, the eluted proteins were mixed with a fivefold molar excess of RUPA-97, LMIV230-01, 2A2, 18F25, RUPA-71, and RUPA-44 Fabs and incubated on ice for 30 min. After concentrating the protein fraction, the Fab-bound complex was separated from unbound Fabs by high-performance size exclusion chromatography using a Bio SEC-3 300 Å column (Agilent, 5190-5213), pre-equilibrated with elution buffer.

#### Recombinant protein production

          Expression and purification of individual Fabs was performed as described previously. (Ref: 20) (Ref: 29) Variable light and heavy chains were gene synthesized (GeneArt), and cloned into a custom pcDNA3.4 expression vector directly upstream of the constant chains. The variable chain sequences for 32F3, TB31F, LMIV-230s, and all RUPA mAbs were described previously. (Ref: 20) (Ref: 29) (Ref: 40) Variable sequences for 18F25 (Table S7) were determined by a previously published workflow for hybridoma sequencing. (Ref: 97) In short, RNA was obtained from 18F25.1 hybridoma cells by Trizol purification, which was used as template for RT-PCR with heavy/kappa constant chain specific reverse primer and a universal template-switching oligonucleotide (Table S6). The obtained cDNA was used for a PCR, and obtained PCR products were inserted into a TOPO vector, and sequenced by Sanger Sequencing (Baseclear, The Netherlands). Variable sequences for 2A2 were sequenced by Genmab (Table S7). For the IgGs produced for complement-fixation assays, sequences of the variable chain of α-Pfs230D1 IgGs were described previously, (Ref: 20) and ordered as synthetic products subcloned into custom-made pcDNA3.4 vectors directly upstream of Igγ1-CH1-CH3 or Igκ-CL1.
          Fab and IgG purification were done in a similar manner. Plasmids coding for Fab/IgG heavy chain and light chain were co-transfected at a 2:1 molar ratio using PEI MAX® transfection reagent (PolySciences) into Freestyle 293-F or 293-S cells (ThermoFisher). Cells were cultured in FreeStyle 293 Expression medium (Gibco) at 37 °C and 8% CO2 while shaking for seven days, after which the supernatant containing secreted recombinant protein was collected. After filtering, the supernatant was used for affinity purification using a HiTrap Kappaselect column (Cytiva) for recombinant Fab, or the HiTrap Protein G HP column (Cytiva) for recombinant IgG, pre-equilibrated in 1x PBS. In both cases, recombinant protein was eluted in 100 mM glycine (pH 2.2). Fabs were further purified by cation-exchange chromatography using a MonoS column (Cytiva) with a buffer of 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.6) across a 0-1.0 M potassium chloride gradient.
          Single Pfs230 domains Pfs230D1 and Pfs230D10 were expressed and purified as described previously. (Ref: 35) Coding sequences for the double Pfs230 domain D13-14-Cterm (residue 2831-3105) were ordered and synthesized as Drosophila melanogaster codon-optimized sequences (Baseclear). The synthetic gene was subcloned into pExpreS2.2 plasmid (ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies), in frame with an N-terminal BiP signal peptide – His6 tag. The expression plasmid was used to transfect D. melanogaster S2 cells (ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies) to generate stable cell lines as described previously. (Ref: 35) Pfs230D13-14-Cterm-containing supernatant was loaded directly on a 1 ml cOmplete™ His-Tag Purification Column (Roche). The column was washed with PBS, and Pfs230D13-14-Cterm was eluted using PBS with 250 mM imidazole. After overnight dialysis against PBS, the sample was concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex200 Increase column (Cytiva), using PBS as running buffer.

#### Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

          For BN-PAGE, the elution fraction from FLAG-based affinity purification, containing purified Pfs230: Pfs48/45 protein complex, was used. To test Fab binding to the complex, a tenfold molar excess of Fab fragment was added to the purified Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex, and incubated on ice for 30 min. A reference sample was created by incubating purified Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex with the same volume of PBS. Protein samples were supplemented with a home-made 1x loading solution (final concentration 10% glycerol, 0.025% Coomassie Blue G-250), and loaded on a NativePAGE™ 3-12% Bis-Tris protein gels (ThermoFisher) following manufacturer’s protocols. NativeMark™ Unstained Protein Standard was used as marker. After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with Coomassie InstantBlue® protein stain (Abcam) or incubated in 0.1% SDS for western blotting. For western blotting, proteins were transferred to 0.45 μm Immun-Blot PVDF membrane (BioRad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer system (BioRad). After transfer, proteins were fixed to the membrane using 8% acetic acid. Membranes were air-dried, washed in pure methanol and re-hydrated using MQ. Blocking, antibody incubation and detection were performed as described above.

#### Mass spectrometry

          Three batches of 40 ml heparin-treated, late-stage gametocyte cultures (iGP2230-tag and iGP2 WT) of comparable gametocytaemia were harvested and lysed in parallel, as described as above for purification of the endogenous Pfs230: Pfs48/45 complex. Protein concentration in parasite lysate was determined using the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay kit. 120 μg of protein extract in 300 μl solubilization buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1x PI, and 0.25% (v/v) DDM) was applied on 10 μl anti-FLAG® M2 affinity resin, and incubated overnight. The resin was washed in ice-cold wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1x PI, and 0.02% DDM) three times, and consequently washed three times in ice-cold PBS (Gibco). After harvesting, beads were resuspended in 50 μl elution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 M Urea, 10 mM DTT), and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with shaking. 50 mM iodoacetamide was added to alkylate cysteines, after which samples were kept in the dark for 10 min at 25 °C. After adding 0.25 μg sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), samples were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking. Samples were spun down, supernatants were collected, and the beads were resuspended in 50 μl fresh elution buffer. After 5 min incubation on a shaker, the samples were spun down again and the supernatant combined with the previous elution fraction. Another 0.1 μg of fresh trypsin was added to the combined supernatants, which was left to digest overnight at 25 °C. The following day, samples were concentrated and purified on C18 StageTips. (Ref: 98) Samples were analyzed on a Obitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific) ran in Top20 mode (with dynamic exclusion enabled for 45 s), operated with an online Easy-nLC 1000. A gradient of buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) was applied for 60 min. Raw data was analyzed using Maxquant software (version 2.1.4.0), (Ref: 73) and analyzed against a Plasmodium database (PlasmoDB, downloaded 21-10-2022). (Ref: 68) LFQ, iBAQ and match between runs were enabled, and deamidation (NQ) was added as additional variable modification. The resulting output was filtered using Perseus (version 1.0.15), removing potential contaminants, reverse hits, and proteins with less than two unique peptides or with less than three valid values in at least one group. Missing values were imputed using default settings, and a t-test was performed to identify outliers.

#### Cryo-EM data collection and image processing

          The Pfs230: Pfs48/45: RUPA-97: LMIV230-01:2A2:18F25: RUPA-71: RUPA-44 Fab complex was concentrated to 0.4 or 0.8 mg/ml, and 1.8 μl of sample was deposited on homemade holey gold grids (Ref: 99) that were glow-discharged in air for 15 s. Excess sample was blotted away for 1.7 s using a Leica EM GP2 Automatic Plunge freezer at 4 °C and 90% humidity, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Data was collected on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Krios G3 equipped with a Selectris X energy filter (slit width: 10 eV) and Falcon 4i camera, operated at 300 kV and automated with the EPU software. Data was collected at a nominal magnification of 130,000× with a calibrated pixel size of 0.93 Å. Exposures were collected for 6.5 s as movies with a camera exposure rate of ∼7.11 or ∼7.15 e− per pixel per s, and a total exposure of ∼50 or ∼53.7 electrons/Å2 and recorded in Electron Event Representation mode. (Ref: 100) A set defocus range of 0.8 - 2.3 μm was used during data collection. Before processing, movies were fractionated into 40 frames. A total of 8,545, 1,572, and 6,533 raw movies were obtained at 0o, 35o, and 40o tilt, respectively, across two data collections. All raw movies were taken of the 0.8 mg/ml sample except for a subset of 1,297 untilted movies taken of the 0.4 mg/ml sample.
          The collected cryo-EM data was processed using CryoSPARC v4.6.0. (Ref: 74) The movies from the 35° tilted, 40° tilted, and untilted data collections were corrected for motion in patches, and contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated in patches. For the Pfs230D1-6: LMIV230-01:2A2: RUPA-97, Pfs230D9-14: Pfs48/45, and Pfs230D13-14: RUPA-44: RUPA-71 maps, resulting micrographs were curated using thresholds for average defocus values (4,000-35,000 Å), CTF fit resolution (2.0-5.0 Å), and relative ice thickness (0.95-1.10). An in silico model of the Pfs230: Pfs48/45: RUPA-97: LMIV230-01:2A2:18F25: RUPA-71: RUPA-44 complex was built from AF models and arranged based on views seen from 2D classes. The resulting model was used to generate particle templates corresponding to 40 evenly distributed projections which were low-pass filtered to 20 Å to avoid model bias. Initially, particle images were selected from a subset of 2,000 curated micrographs, which were then extracted in 450x450 pixel boxes and subjected to 2D classification. Classes where the average showed clear views of the complex were used to train a Topaz particle selection model, (Ref: 75) with subsequent 2D classification steps used to clean the dataset of selected particle images. To focus on the various subsections of the full complex, 2D class average images showing the appropriate domains were used as templates to select more particles from the full dataset of 12,192 curated micrographs. Further Topaz models were trained on specific regions (Pfs230D1-6: RUPA-97: LMIV230-01:2A2, Pfs230D9-14: Pfs48/45: RUPA-71: RUPA-44) of the full complex, after which particles images were selected and extracted with the trained models. Initial junk particle image removal was performed with multiple rounds of 2D classification, followed by ab initio 3D reconstruction. Non-particle images and poorly behaved particle images were removed with a combination of heterogeneous refinement, 3D classification, and 2D classification. Selected particle images were used to generate 3D maps with reconstructions in non-uniform refinement (Ref: 101) jobs without enforced symmetry (C1). The resulting maps were further improved by local refinement and post-processing with DeepEMhancer (Ref: 76) and EMReady. (Ref: 77) Heterogeneity for 2A2 Fab binding could be distinctly observed, such that two maps of Pfs230D1-6: LMIV230-01: RUPA-97 were obtained: with and without 2A2 Fab. A detailed processing flow path and experimental map details are available in the supplementary document (Figure S2).

#### X-ray crystallography

          Fractions containing purified 2A2, 18F25, and RUPA-71 Fab following cationic exchange chromatography were pooled and concentrated at 16.8 mg/mL, 27.3 mg/mL, and 10 mg/ml, respectively in preparation for crystallization trials. RUPA-71 Fab was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with reservoir conditions from a JCSG Top96 screen (0.2 μL + 0.2 μL) using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. RUPA-71 crystals formed in a drop containing 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M MES 6.5 pH, and 30 %w/v PEG MME 5K and were then cryo-protected with glycerol prior to freezing. For the 2A2 and 18F25 Fab crystallization trials, reservoir conditions from a JCSG Top96 screen and Fab were mixed at a 1:1 volumetric ratio (0.3 μL + 0.3 μL) resulting in 0.6 μL drops. Approximately 48 h after setting drops at room temperature, 2A2 crystals were obtained from a drop containing reservoir solution: 30% (w/v) PEG 4K. 18F25 crystals were obtained from a drop containing reservoir solution: 0.2 M Na2SO4 and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. The 2A2 and 18F25 crystals were cryo-protected with 25% glycerol (v/v) and 15% polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200), respectively. Crystals of all three samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data collection on 2A2 and 18F25 was performed at the 17-ID-1 beamline at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Synchrotron Light Source (Beam wavelength = 0.920194 Å). RUPA-71 data collection occurred at the CMCF-ID beamline at the Canadian Light Source (Beam wavelength = 0.95357 Å).

#### X-ray crystallography model building

          Datasets were processed using autoproc, (Ref: 78)xds, (Ref: 79) and aimless. (Ref: 80) A molecular replacement solution was obtained using PhaserMR (Ref: 81) using an in silico-derived model of the Fab domains predicted via ABodyBuilder2. (Ref: 102) (Ref: 82) Model building and refinement was performed using Coot (Ref: 83) and phenix. refine. (Ref: 103) For the RUPA-71 Fab crystal structure, 98.0% of the dihedral angles are in “favoured regions” of the Ramachandran plot; 2.0% are in the “allowed regions;” and 0% are “outliers.” For the 2A2 Fab crystal structure, 98.3% of the dihedral angles are in “favoured regions” of the Ramachandran plot; 1.7% are in the “allowed regions;” and 0% are “outliers.” For the 18F25 Fab crystal structure, 97.4% of the dihedral angles are in “favoured regions” of the Ramachandran plot; 2.6% are in the “allowed regions;” and 0% are “outliers.” (Table S3). Inter- and intra-molecular contacts were determined using PISA, (Ref: 104) UCSF ChimeraX, (Ref: 85) and manual inspection. Structural figures were generated using UCSF ChimeraX. (Ref: 85)

#### Cryo-EM model building

          Starting structural models were obtained by manually fitting previously determined structural models (PDB: 8U1P [Pfs48/45D1-2],7UXL [Pfs48/45D3: RUPA-44],7UVQ [Pfs230-D1: RUPA-97], 7UFW [Pfs230-D1-2: LMIV230-01]), crystal structures (Fabs of 18F25, RUPA-71, and 2A2), and models generated by AlphaFold2 (Ref: 105)and AlphaFold3 (Ref: 106) into the experimentally determined maps. Structural refinements were performed using Isolde (Ref: 86), PyRosetta, (Ref: 87) and PHENIX (Ref: 84); models were manually checked and improved with Coot. (Ref: 83) Images were generated using ChimeraX. (Ref: 85) Access to all software was supported through SBGrid. (Ref: 107)

#### Single nucleotide polymorphism detection

          Single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained from the MalariaGEN Catalogue of Genetic Variation in Pf version 7. (Ref: 51) Genotype calls for chromosomes 2 and 13 (Pf3D7_02_v3 and Pf3D7_13_v3, respectively) were downloaded (https://ngs. sanger. ac. uk/production/malaria/Resource/34/Pf7_vcf/). Bcftools (Ref: 88) was used to subset calls and calculate the allele frequencies between nucleotide positions 369,351 and 380,156(+) on chromosome 2 that coincide with Pfs230 and between nucleotide positions 1,875,452 and 1,878,087(-) on chromosome 13 that coincide with Pfs48/45. SNPs calls below MalariaGEN’s quality filter (Low_VQSLOD) were removed before identification of missense variants.

#### Gamete binding assay with flow cytometry

          Heparin treated stage V gametocytes (day 13 – 16 post induction) were collected and resuspended in FCS with half the volume of the original culture volume. Gamete maturation was induced for 30 min at room temperature while shaking, after which samples were centrifuged at 2,000xg at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and placed on a layer of 12.4% Nycodenz (Serumwerk Bernburg) and centrifuged for 30 min at 3,500xg without break at 4°C. The top layer containing female gametes was harvested and washed in PBS before continuing. 50,000 female gametes per well were deposited in a V-bottom non-treated 96-well plate (Costar). All gamete incubations were carried out at RT in PBS supplemented with 2% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Gibco) and 0.02% sodium azide, and washed in ice-cold PBS. All secondary antibody incubations included eBioscience™ Fixable Viability Dye eFluor™ 780 (Invitrogen, 1:1000). For the Pfs230 domain binding experiment (Figure S5A), gametes were incubated for 1 h with recombinant proteins and washed in PBS. Afterwards, gametes were incubated with mouse anti-his tag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, A7058, 1:200) for 1 h, washed, and stained with chicken-anti-mouse 488 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, A21200, 1:200) for 30 min. For the antibody gamete binding experiment (Figures 6B and S5H), gametes were incubated with 1 μg/ml antibody for 1 h, washed, and stained with goat-anti-human 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen, A11013, 1:200). For the Fab competition experiment (Figure S6F), gametes were incubated for 1 h with Fabs. After washing in PBS, gametes were stained with 18F25 antibody labeled with LYNX Rapid Plus DyLight488 Antibody Conjugation Kit (Bio-Rad, 5 μg/ml). Finally, for complement deposition assay (Figures 6C and 6D), gametes were incubated with 1 μg/ml antibody for 1 h and washed. Gametes were then incubated with 10% Normal Human Serum (Sanquin, The Netherlands) and incubated for 45 min at RT. After washing, parasites were first stained with polyclonal goat anti-human C1q (#A200, CompTech, 1:5,000) or anti-human C3 (#A213, CompTech, 1:10,000), washed, and finally stained with donkey-anti-goat 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen, A11055, 1:200). After staining, gametes were resuspended in PBS and fluorescence was measured for approximately 2,000 gametes with the Gallios™ 10-color system (Beckman Coulter). For all flow cytometry gamete binding experiments only live gametes were analyzed, except for the complement deposition assays for which both live and dead gametes were included in the analysis (gating strategy in Figure S5M).

#### DNA extraction and analysis of midgut oocysts

          Mosquito midguts were dissected into individual tubes seven days after the infectious blood meal, and DNA was extracted using a protocol modified from Ranford-Cartwrigth et al. (Ref: 108) In short, the midgut was incubated at 56 °C overnight in oocyst lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% N-lauroyl sarcosine, 1 mg/ml Proteinase K). DNA was extracted from the lysate using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by isopropanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was washed with 70% EtOH, dried and redissolved in 20 μl ultra-pure water. The presence of wildtype or truncated pfs230 gene was confirmed with a semi-nested PCR protocol (Table S6) as described previously. (Ref: 37)

#### Pfs230D7-18F25 SPR binding analysis

          The gene sequences coding for Pfs230D7, including the SNP mutant sequences, were optimized for wheat codon usage, purchased from GenScript, and cloned into a pEU-E01 expression vector (CellFree Science, Matsuyama, Japan). The recombinant Pfs230D7 proteins were expressed as C-terminally His-tagged proteins in wheat germ cell-free extract WEPRO7240H (CellFree Science), supplemented with Disulfide Bond Enhancer Enzyme Set (CellFree Science). Proteins were purified by single-step His-tag purification using a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (Cytiva), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
          The binding kinetics between recombinant Pfs230D7 proteins and 18F25 were measured using a Biacore X100 instrument (Cytiva). The antibody 18F25 was immobilized on the sensor chip using the Mouse Antibody Capture Kit (Cytiva) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant Pfs230D7 proteins were injected in HBS-EP+ running buffer (Cytiva) using a single-cycle kinetic format.

### Quantification and statistical analysis

        Confocal microscopy images were processed for Airyscan imaging using Zeiss Zen Blue Software. All other microscopy data analysis was done using FIJI software (ImageJ 1.54f), (Ref: 72) using the same brightness/contrast settings per experiment. All flow cytometry experiments were analyzed with FlowJo (BD, version v10.10.0). Binding kinetics experiments using SPR were analyzed with Biacore X100 Evaluation Software, and kinetic parameters were calculated using a 1:1 binding model. Transmission Reducing Activity for mAb 2A2 compared to FCS-only controls was calculated using a previously described mixed-effect negative binomial regression model that accounts for correlation between mosquito observation from the same feeding experiment. (Ref: 109)
        All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 10.4.1), and details are described in the figure legends. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Figure 4: Heterodimer dissociation is not the main mode of action of Pfs48/45-directed antibodies

(A) Structure of RUPA-71 with contact residues shown as sticks bound to Pfs48/45D1 depicted as surface and colored by electrostatic potential calculated by adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann solver (APBS) and visualized in ChimeraX.

(B) RUPA-71 HCDR3 (gold) interface with Pfs48/45D1 (yellow green) with contact residues on Pfs48/45 highlighted in dark green. Dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions.

(C and D) Model of Pfs48/45 (gray) bound to Pfs230D13–14 (misty rose) in the disk-like (C) or extended (D) conformation bound to Pfs48/45D3-1a binders (TB31F [orchid, PDB: 6E63], RUPA-29 [dark magenta, PDB: 7UXL], RUPA-47 [violet red, PDB: 7UNB], and 32F3 [pale violet red, PDB: 7ZWI]). Clashes are indicated with yellow stars.

(E) BN-PAGE-based mobility shift assay of FLAG-tag purified Pfs230:Pfs48/45 complex, incubated with 10-fold excess Fabs. PBS and anti-HIV PGDM1400 in the left image were used as reference and negative control, respectively. Fabs are sorted by antigen, epitope, and potency (underlined: IC80 < 10 μg/mL; bold: IC80 = 10–100 μg/mL; others: IC80 > 100 μg/mL; Table S1). Note that due to the nature of BN-PAGE, the hydrodynamic radius and therefore the angle of approach can heavily influence the extent of Fab-induced mobility retardation. The symbols #, ∗, ×, and + denote Pfs230, Pfs230:Pfs48/45, Pfs230:Fab, and Pfs230:Pfs48/45:Fab, respectively. Symbols are present on the left and right sides to denote each component(s) and below to summarize what is observed in the lane overall.

(F) Infection of An. stephensi mosquitoes with WT NF54 (white), Pfs230ΔD13/14 (red), and Pfs230ΔCterm (pink) as measured in five independent SMFAs. n/20 denotes the number of mosquitoes that carry at least 1 oocyst. Mean is the mean number of oocysts per midgut.

(G) TRA of 2A2 in mosquito infections with NF54 WT (white) and Pfs230ΔCterm (pink) gametocytes, in the presence of active human complement (n = 2). Mean with 95% CIs are shown. A one-tailed t test was used to test whether TRA was higher than 0%: ns, not significant; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.

See also Figure S6 and Tables S1, S3, and S4.


### Figure 5: Potent Pfs230 epitopes outside of Pfs230D1 exhibit varying degrees of sequence diversity in parasite strains

(A) The variable region of 2A2 (green) and Pfs230D4 (orange) are shown with key contacts (inset) made by the HCDR1-3 and KCDR3 (shades of blue) of mAb 2A2 with the Pfs230D4 β6-β7 β-hairpin (gold) highlighted.

(B) SNPs of Pfs230D4-2A2 epitope identified in the MalariaGEN Pf7 database (Ref: 51) are indicated in purple. The frequency of the SNP is shown as a subscript. (Right) Five strains of P. falciparum harboring different combinations of five different SNPs (x axis) with the BSA that each residue contributes to binding in the structural model (y axis). Residues found exclusively in P. falciparum strains that have a perturbed ability to bind female gametes are colored in shades of purple and appear above the dotted line. The strains to which 2A2 exhibited no binding (Ref: 37) are shaded grey.

(C) The variable region of 18F25 (tan) and Pfs230D7 (teal) are shown. 18F25 makes contacts with the Pfs230D7-ID (light green) and the β8-β9 region (dark green) using all HCDRs (shades of red) and KCDRs (shades of pink) (inset).

(D) SNPs in or near the Pfs230D7-18F25 epitope identified in the MalariaGEN Pf7 database (Ref: 51) are indicated and labeled as done earlier. V1801 is not resolved in the structural model. (Right) Summary of SPR experiments utilizing 18F25 Fab and Pfs230D7 variants (WT, teal; SNP mutants, purple) and their determined affinity (y axis).

### Figure 6: Pfs230-directed antibody potency is determined by complement factor binding capacity

(A) The binding sites of 18F25, LMIV230-01, 2A2, RUPA-97, RUPA-38, and rh4F12 shown in the context of Pfs230 (gray, surface) and Pfs48/45 (black, surface). The antibodies are colored in accordance with their IC80 values in SMFA with darker colors indicating higher TRA (left scale).

(B–D) Anti-Pfs230D1 mAb binding (B), or antibody-mediated human C1q (C) and human C3 deposition (D) at 1 μg/mL on the surface of WT NF54 macrogametes. CIS43, an anti-P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein antibody, was included as a negative control. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were normalized against the mean of RUPA-97 replicates, to allow averaging across two independent experiments (depicted as different symbols, circles and squares) with two to three technical replicates each. Mean with standard deviations are shown. Statistical analysis was done using an ordinary one-way ANOVA with either a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test with a single pooled variance (B) or Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test with a single pooled variance comparing all groups to negative control antibody, CIS43 (C and D). ns, not significant; ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.
