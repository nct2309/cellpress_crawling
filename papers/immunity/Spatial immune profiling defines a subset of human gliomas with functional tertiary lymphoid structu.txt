## Highlights

    •Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are present in 15% of adult-type diffuse gliomas•Glioma-associated TLSs feature clonal lymphocyte expansion and plasma cell formation•Functional TLS maturation is facilitated by an immune-permissive microenvironment•Stratification of gliomas based on TLS maturity has prognostic relevance

## Summary

    Adult-type diffuse gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors, respond poorly to immune-based therapies and are considered immunologically “cold” tumors. Here, we examined the features and clinical relevance of glioma intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) using spatial transcriptome and proteome profiling. In a cohort of 642 gliomas, TLSs were present in 15% of tumors and associated with a remodeled perivascular space and spatial redistribution of extracellular matrix components. Three distinct TLS subtypes could be defined based on differing cellular composition and immune activity. While all subtypes lacked classical germinal center architecture, certain TLSs exhibited features of dynamic immune functions, including clonal T and B cell expansion, generation of IgA⁺ and IgG⁺ plasma cells, and dendritic cell-T cell interactions. The presence of TLSs with active immune response features correlated with improved overall survival. Thus, a functional adaptive immune response is detectable in some gliomas, with implications for stratification and treatment.

## Introduction

      The advent of immune checkpoint therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment in several solid cancers. (Ref: 1) However, tumors residing within the central nervous system (CNS) remain a clinical challenge and often represent a difficult target for immunotherapy. (Ref: 2) Hallmarks of CNS neoplasms are brain-resident cell types and a restrictive blood-brain barrier with distinctive extracellular matrix (ECM) components that interfere with immune cell infiltration and drug delivery into the tumor parenchyma. (Ref: 2) (Ref: 3) Among primary CNS tumors, adult-type diffuse gliomas, classified based on the presence or absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, are most common. (Ref: 4) (Ref: 5) Owing to its aggressive, highly invasive, and angiogenic growth pattern, the most frequent malignant adult-type diffuse glioma, IDH wild-type glioblastoma (IDH-WT GBM), is currently incurable with a median patient survival of less than 21 months. (Ref: 5) (Ref: 6) (Ref: 7) The standard treatment for IDH-WT GBM includes gross surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. (Ref: 8) Attempts to incorporate immune checkpoint inhibition in glioma therapy have largely failed, (Ref: 5) (Ref: 6) (Ref: 7) (Ref: 8) (Ref: 9) partly due to T cell exclusion and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). (Ref: 10) (Ref: 11) (Ref: 12) (Ref: 13)
      Intratumoral immune aggregates, such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), are proposed to mediate sustained anti-tumor immune responses. (Ref: 14) (Ref: 15) (Ref: 16) (Ref: 17) (Ref: 18) (Ref: 19) (Ref: 20) (Ref: 21) TLSs are ectopically formed aggregates of lymphoid and stromal cells, comprising T cell zones with antigen-presenting dendritic cells, and B cell zones with germinal centers. (Ref: 19) (Ref: 20) (Ref: 21) TLSs support local immune responses through several mechanisms, including antigen presentation to T cells (Ref: 22) (Ref: 23) or differentiation of B cells into plasma cells that secrete tumor-specific antibodies. (Ref: 18) (Ref: 19) (Ref: 20) (Ref: 21) (Ref: 22) (Ref: 23) (Ref: 24) These roles in adaptive immunity make TLSs a promising biomarker for patient stratification in immune checkpoint therapy of various cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer. (Ref: 25) (Ref: 26)
      TLSs are also present in some adult-type diffuse gliomas. (Ref: 27) (Ref: 28) (Ref: 29) (Ref: 30) (Ref: 31) However, there is limited insight into the functionality of these structures in anti-glioma immunity and their association with patient survival. Although TLSs are seen in various cancer types, their composition and features in gliomas require specific investigation, given the immune privilege of the brain and the immunosuppressive nature of the glioma microenvironment.
      Here, we aimed to systematically study the prevalence and clinical relevance of TLSs in a large glioma patient cohort (n = 642 gliomas) and determine the spatial architecture and immunological function of glioma-associated TLSs. We found evidence for clonal lymphocyte expansion and plasma cell formation within glioma-associated TLSs, indicative of immunological function. Multi-modal spatial profiling revealed non-canonical expression of ECM components and remodeling of the glioma vasculature that accompanies TLS formation and maturation. Maturation of TLSs into sites of dynamic, adaptive immune responses depended on the TME and was inhibited in peri-necrotic tumor regions. Importantly, functional TLSs were associated with improved overall survival. Our findings point to the presence of active immunity despite the immunosuppressive glioma TME, and they suggest that TLS can serve as a predictive biomarker for a subset of gliomas with an immune-permissive microenvironment that may be susceptible to immunotherapy.

## Results

### Study design for TLS identification and multi-omics characterization

        The prevalence and clinical relevance of glioma-associated TLSs were determined by screening a cohort of 452 IDH-WT and 190 IDH-mutant (IDH-mut) adult-type diffuse gliomas, using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based imaging approach (Figures 1A and S1A; Table S1). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-tissue sections (n = 642) were screened for CD20+ B cells. Lymphoid aggregates, with a minimum of 50 CD20+ B cells positioned adjacent to CD3+ T cells, and LAMP3+ mature dendritic cells (Ref: 16) (Ref: 32) were considered TLSs and further analyzed using a multi-modal spatial profiling approach (Figure 1A). We applied bulk RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptome profiling (whole transcriptome, GeoMx DSP), whole-slide multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining (6 markers with LabSat and VectraPolaris; 31 markers with COMET; markers listed in Table S2), and spatial single-cell analysis (Xenium with custom gene panel, Table S3) to consecutive sections of the same tissue specimen (Figure 1A). This approach allowed us to trace a single TLS through the different molecular layers (Figures 1A and S1B).

### Prevalence and clinical relevance of TLS in adult-type diffuse glioma

        Our screening revealed 15% of gliomas with at least one TLS, which we classified as TLS+, while the remaining were considered as TLS− (Figure 1A). TLSs were localized to both the tumor parenchyma and the leptomeninges (Figures S1B, S1C, and S1D) and were more commonly found in proximity to leptomeninges (Figures S1E and S1F). Tumors with at least one leptomeningeal TLS exhibited a higher rate of meningeal enhancement on radiological imaging (Figure S1G).
        Our specimen collection included 434 primary and 208 recurrent gliomas with a slightly higher prevalence of TLSs in primary tumors compared with recurrent tumors (Figure 1B). By applying multinomial logistic regression, we determined that the presence of TLSs was independent of the IDH mutation status (p = 0.57), negatively associated with tumor recurrence (p = 0.03), and positively associated with male sex (p = 0.02) and temporoparietal tumor location (p = 0.01) (Figures 1C and S1H–S1J). For IDH-WT tumors, the prevalence of TLSs was independent of the methylation-based classification into mesenchymal, RTKI, and RTKII GBM subtypes (Figure S1K). Survival data and follow-up data were available for 382 patients. Using multinomial Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we identified TLS status as a positive predictor for overall survival and progression-free survival independent of IDH mutational status, sex, and age at diagnosis (Figures 1D and S1L).
        Adaptive immune responses in other tumor entities are associated with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) leading to the availability of tumor-specific antigens. (Ref: 33) However, when comparing the TMB values between TLS+ and TLS− gliomas, no significant difference was observed (Figure S1M). Three tumors (2 TLS+, 1 TLS−) showed hypermutation with a TMB value ≥ 17 mutations/Mb.

### TLS+ gliomas are enriched for transcripts reminiscent of vascular and ECM remodeling and depleted for neuronal signatures

        Next, we compared the transcriptional profiles of TLS+ (n = 44) and TLS− (n = 20) adult-type diffuse gliomas and performed differential gene expression analysis followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Figures 2 and S2). TLS− tumors were characterized by higher expression of transcripts related to neuronal identity and synaptic function, independent of the IDH mutational status of the tumor or patient’s sex (Figures 2A and S2A–S2F). Transcripts upregulated in TLS− tumors included SYT4, TNR, and RAPGEF (Figures 2A, S2C, and S2D; Table S4), which are expressed at high levels by neurons according to a single-cell reference map of the GBM TME. (Ref: 34)
        In contrast, TLS+ tumors showed higher levels of transcripts typically expressed by B cells and plasma cells, including immunoglobulin gene segments such as IGHG1, IGHA1, or IGKC, as well as transcripts linked to interferon and interleukin signaling (IL2RB and IL1R1) (Figures 2A, S2C, and S2D; Table S4). Transcriptional cell-type deconvolution revealed an overall enrichment of immune cells, including dendritic cells, plasma cells, and myeloid cells, in the TLS+ tumors (Figure 2B).
        In addition, TLS+ tumors expressed higher levels of transcripts related to collagen matrix, such as COL6A1, COL1A1, and COL3A1, and ECM remodeling, e. g., MMP7 (Figures 2A, S2C, and S2D; Table S4). While Col6A1 expression is non-canonical (Ref: 36) and was absent in the normal brain (Figures S2G–S2I), its deposition increased around glioma vessels, with an expansion of the Col6A1 network in larger TLSs, as illustrated by spatial proteome profiling (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2G). According to our spatial single-cell transcriptome profiling (Xenium), mural cells and fibroblasts constituted the main source of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and COL6A1 expression (Figures 2E and S3). Indeed, transcriptional cell-type deconvolution indicated an enrichment of mural cells in TLS+ tumors (Figure 2B). Furthermore, we observed the restructuring of Col4 around vessels, which constitutes an element of the blood-brain barrier (Ref: 3) (Ref: 37) (Ref: 38) (Ref: 39) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2G). Of note, we identified Col4 fragments within CD163+ macrophages, suggestive of an uptake of ECM components by tumor-associated macrophages (Ref: 40) (Figures 2D and S2G).
        The high endothelial venule (HEV) markers MAdCAM-1 and PNAd were not detected in the TLS+ glioma samples, indicating limited endothelial specialization for lymphocyte trafficking (Figure S2J and S2K). Although HEVs are observed in murine glioma models, (Ref: 27) (Ref: 28) their presence in human gliomas remains controversial.

### Three distinct TLS subtypes with differences in cellular composition

        We next investigated the heterogeneity of glioma-associated TLSs by analyzing the transcriptional profiles of 61 TLSs from 20 different tumor samples. Between one and six TLS regions of interest (ROIs) per sample were selected based on CD20+ immunofluorescence staining, and an adjacent CD20− tumor-rich region was included as a control ROI. Immune cell transcripts such as MS4A1, CD19, CD3D, and PTPRC were expressed two to three times higher in TLS ROIs, compared with those in tumor control ROIs (Figure S4A).
        We applied dimensionality reduction and clustering to the transcriptional profiles of TLS ROIs, thereby identifying three TLS subtypes with distinct transcriptional profiles (Figures 3A and S4B–S4D). The first TLS subtype, which we named “T-low-TLS” (low T cell abundance), was characterized by the expression of transcripts such as ACOT2, GRIN2C, and ABCB9, which are preferentially expressed by neurons or astrocytes, according to the GBM single-cell reference atlas (Figures 3A and 3B). Transcriptional cell-type deconvolution also indicated that tumor cells of the neuronal-like and stem-like lineages were enriched in T-low-TLS (Figure 3C). The second TLS subtype, named “B: T-TLS” (interactions of B and T cells), was characterized by the expression of genes related to antigen presentation (CD74, HLA-B, HLA-DRA), which are predominantly expressed by macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells (Figures 3A and 3B). The third TLS subtype, denominated “PC-TLS” (plasma cell rich), showed higher levels of genes expressed by plasma cells, e. g., immunoglobulin gene segments, DERL3, or TENT5C (Figures 3A and 3B). Transcriptional cell-type deconvolution indicated that B cells, T cells, and mural cells were more abundant in B: T-TLS and PC-TLS, compared with T-low-TLS (Figure 3D).
        When matching the TLS subtype annotation from spatial transcriptomics to highplex immunofluorescence and spatial single-cell profiling data, these differences in cellular composition could be confirmed (Figures 3E, S4F, S4G, and S3). B: T-TLS and PC-TLS showed higher proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, compared with T-low-TLS, whereas CD163+ macrophages were enriched in T-low-TLS (Figure 3E). PC-TLS had higher nuclei counts and occupied larger areas than both T-low-TLS and B: T-TLS (Figures 3F and 3G). No significant association was found between IDH mutation status and TLS subtype (Figure 3A).

### B:T-TLS and PC-TLS show evidence for dynamic adaptive immune responses

        TLSs often organize into distinct T and B cell areas (zonation), similar to functional regions of germinal centers within lymph nodes. (Ref: 41) Since the TLSs in our glioma samples showed considerable amounts of T cells and plasma cells, we next investigated whether they also showed signs of germinal center-like reactions (Figure 4). We did not identify classical germinal centers with extensive lymphocyte proliferation in the glioma-associated TLSs (Figures 4A, S4F, and S4G). Nevertheless, we observed evidence for B/T cell zonation, as the analysis of the mIF images revealed that the average distance between T cells and their closest B cell was slightly greater in B: T-TLS and PC-TLS as compared with T-low-TLS (Figure 4B). The percentage of T cells within a 15-μm distance of B cells was lower in B: T-TLS and PC-TLS, compared with T-low-TLS (Figure 4C). These findings suggest that T and B cells are more intermixed in T-low-TLS, whereas they tend to accumulate in separate zones in B: T-TLS and PC-TLS, as illustrated in a representative density heatmap of B and T cells across the three TLS subtypes (Figure 4D).
        Highplex immunofluorescence staining identified proliferating CD20+Ki67+ B cells and CD4+Ki67+ T cells, which accumulated in the corresponding B cell- and T cell-rich areas of TLSs, indicating proliferation and clonal expansion of adaptive immune cells within TLSs (Figure 4E). Proliferating B cells and CD4 T cells were found in all TLS subtypes, and their percentage was highest in B: T-TLS, comprising ∼3% of all B cells and ∼4% of all CD4 T cells (Figures 4F and 4G). In line with these finding, the maximal B cell density was highest in the B: T-TLS cluster (Figure S5A), suggestive of B cell aggregation by B cell clonal expansion, whereas the average density of B cells was comparable throughout the different TLS types (Figure S5B). Our data further provided evidence for CD4+PD1+ICOS+ T cells of the follicular helper T cell (Tfh) phenotypes, with no significant differences between the TLS subtypes (Figures S5F and S5G).
        Between 60% and 90% of all B cells, and 30% to 80% of all macrophages within TLSs displayed a CD74+ phenotype, indicative of antigen presentation function (Figures 4H–4J, S5D, and S5J). LAMP3+ dendritic cells localized close to T cells (Figure 4E) and constituted approximately 2% of all immune cells within B: T-TLS but less than 0.5% in the other subtypes (Figure 4K). CD23 was not detected in any of the TLSs analyzed using mIF imaging, suggesting an absence of follicular dendritic cells (Figures 4A, S4F, and S4G). Transcripts of AICDA, CR2, CXCL12, and CXCL13 were found at low levels in some but not all TLS+ tumors, suggesting a lack of consistent expression of these maturity markers in glioma-associated TLSs (Figure S5C).

### B cell to plasma cell differentiation within glioma-associated TLS

        The formation of plasma cells is one of the functional outcomes of TLS and is associated with the production of tumor-reactive antibodies. (Ref: 21) (Ref: 41) We therefore next examined the cellular and immunological features of plasma cell formation within the glioma-associated TLS. Highplex immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of class-switched plasma cells with IgG+CD38+MZB1+ and IgA+CD38+MZB1+ phenotypes inside and outside of TLS regions (Figures 5A and 5B). Notably, the highest proportion of plasma cells in and around TLS was associated with PC-TLS and some B: T-TLS (Figures 5A and 5B).
        To further explore B cell differentiation, we leveraged the data from spatial single-cell transcriptome profiling (Xenium) to compute a B cell differentiation score for all B cells and plasma cells within an individual TLS (Figure 5C). The analysis revealed a continuum of differentiation stages, ranging from mature-naive B cells (TCL1A, IGHD) to memory-like B cells (IGHG1, CD27, CD19) and plasmablast-like B cells (CD19, CD20, CD27, CD38) in all three TLS types (Figure 5C). More differentiated plasma cells, marked by high expression of IGHG or IGHA along with MZB1 and lower expression of CD19 and MS4A1, were mainly found in the PC-TLS type (Figure 5C).
        To examine the clonal dynamics of B cell and plasma cells within the tumor tissue, we performed bulk sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy-chain transcripts from fresh-frozen tissue specimen of TLS+ gliomas and TLS− gliomas (Figures 5D–5F). Owing to the nature of bulk sequencing, the results primarily capture transcripts originating from plasma cells, which exhibit the highest levels of immunoglobulin expression. No immunoglobulin cDNA could be amplified from the TLS− tumors, serving as a negative control. Analysis of immunglobulin repertoires from three TLS+ gliomas revealed a predominance of transcripts from immunoglobulin G (IgG) and to a lesser extent IgA isotype (Figure 5D), consistent with the plasma cell phenotypes observed in immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomic data (Figures 5A–5C). Additionally, we observed expanded clonal families of immunoglobulin heavy chains arising from the same original VDJ recombination event (Figure 5E). These clonal families exhibit multiple immunoglobulin isotypes (IGHG, IGHA) and extensive somatic hypermutation (Figure 5F). Altogether, our findings indicate an active process of naive B cell differentiation into plasma cells and memory B cells, which is accompanied by affinity maturation and class-switch recombination of clonal B cell families within the tumor tissue.

### Cellular interactions between cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells in B:T-TLS and PC-TLS

        Another TLS feature, which is associated with improved anti-tumor immunity in other tumor entities, is the education of cytotoxic T cells by TLS-resident dendritic cells. (Ref: 41) Our previous analyses revealed that LAMP3+ dendritic cells are enriched in B: T-TLS (Figure 4K). To further investigate the functional importance of these dendritic cells in TLS, we leveraged the Xenium spatial single-cell transcriptomic data to analyze T cell subtypes and their interactions with dendritic cells.
        Through subclustering of the T cell population, we identified distinct T cell subsets (Th17 lymphoid tissue inducer [LTi], Tfh, CD8+ cytotoxic I, and CD8+ cytotoxic II), which were classified based on their marker gene expression profiles (Figures 6A and S6A–S6C). We observed clear differences between the two CD8+ cytotoxic subgroups; CD8+ cytotoxic I expressed markers such as GZMK, GZMA, and EOMES, whereas CD8+ cytotoxic II uniquely expressed high levels of GZMB, GNLY, and KLRD1 (Figures 6A and S6A). Receptor-ligand interaction modeling indicated significant interactions between dendritic cells and T cell subtypes mediated by integrins, CTLA4 and CD28 (Figure 6B). CD8+ cytotoxic II exhibited the highest expression of ITGAX and ITGAM, integrins that facilitate interactions with ICAM1 expressed by dendritic cells (Figures 6A and 6B). We next quantified the distances between T cell subsets and dendritic cells. CD8+ cytotoxic II were significantly closer to dendritic cells than any other T cell subset, including CD8+ cytotoxic I (Figures 6C–6E). This spatial proximity, together with the results from receptor-ligand interaction modeling, suggests preferential interactions between CD8+ cytotoxic II T cells and dendritic cells within B: T-TLS.

### B:T-TLS, PC-TLS, and T-low-TLS differ in their vascular and chemokine profile

        Our molecular spatial profiling identified three TLS subtypes characterized by qualitative differences in cellular interactions, lymphocyte clonal expansion, and plasma cell formation. We next investigated whether these functional differences were linked to differences in TLS initiation and immune cell recruitment. Glioma-associated TLS formation is driven by the early recruitment of Th17-like CD4+ T cells exhibiting LTi function. (Ref: 29) (Ref: 30) (Ref: 42) These LTi cells stimulate macrophages, which in turn act as lymphoid tissue organizer (LTo) cells by secreting chemokines essential for TLS initiation. (Ref: 29) (Ref: 30)
        In our subclustering of T cells in Xenium data, we identified Th17 LTi T cells that are characterized by expression of marker genes consistent with those of previously reported LTi T cells (CD4, IL7R, LTB; Figure S6A). (Ref: 29) (Ref: 30) Although Th17 LTi cells were found in all three TLS subtypes, they were most prevalent in T-low-TLS, where they constituted on average 50% of all T cells (Figure S6B) and ca. 9% of all cells in the TLSs (Figure S6C). We also explored the expression of CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13, the main chemokines involved in lymphoid tissue organization. (Ref: 29) (Ref: 30) Macrophages in B: T-TLS significantly more frequently expressed CCL19 than macrophages in the other TLS subtypes (Figure S6E).
        T cell recruitment into TLS involves interaction with vascular adhesion molecules and subsequent migration across the blood-brain barrier, a multistep process orchestrated by a range of adhesion receptors and signaling molecules. (Ref: 43) In our data, the fraction of endothelial cells expressing adhesion molecules involved in the early stages of T cell adhesion, such as SELE and SELP, was comparable across all TLS subtypes, with the exception of VCAM1, which was less expressed in PC-TLS (Figure S6D). Furthermore, PC-TLS vasculature displayed increased expression of markers associated with permeability and angiogenesis (ANGPT2, PLVALP, SPARCL1) (Figures S6D and S6F). This also coincided with the finding that small ANGPT2+ vessels formed around a large main vessel in PC-TLS (Figure S6F).
        These findings suggested that all three TLS subtypes were equally efficient in recruiting the initial LTi cells. B: T-TLS showed highest levels of chemokines expressed by LTo cells, and PC-TLS showed an angiogenic vascular phenotype, which could be indicative of an expansion of the vascular network induced by the ongoing immune response. In fact, these vascular and chemokine profiles suggest that T-low-TLS, B: T-TLS, and PC-TLS represent different TLS maturation stages and that T-low-TLS have not (yet) made the transition from the LTi stage to the LTo stage and further.

### Functional TLS as a biomarker for an immune-permissive microenvironment and immunotherapy susceptibility

        To further explore the differentiation and maturation dynamics of TLSs, we aimed to determine the distribution of the different TLS subtypes across tumors. By quantifying the number of TLSs per TLS subtype in each tumor, we observed that while multiple TLS subtypes could exist within the same tumor, typically one TLS subtype predominated (Figures 7A and 7B). Based on this observation, we categorized TLS+ tumors into two groups: “TLStype1 gliomas,” which contained a majority of B: T-TLS and PC-TLS (the most maturated and functional subtypes of TLSs observed in glioma), and “TLStype2 gliomas,” which were enriched for less functional T-low-TLS (Figures 7A and 7B).
        Tumor-intrinsic factors appeared to influence TLS subtype distribution. Specifically, pathways related to cell cycle, glycolysis, hypoxia, and VEGF signaling were lower expressed in TLStype2 tumors, compared with TLStype1 tumors and tumors without TLS (Figure 7C). The lower proliferation rate of TLStype2 tumors, compared with TLStype1 tumors, was also confirmed when comparing the immunohistochemical Ki67+ score (Figure 7D). Additionally, our analyses revealed that TLStype2 gliomas harbor more extensive necrotic areas than TLStype1 gliomas (Figures 7E and S7A). An enrichment of PC-TLS and B: T-TLS was observed in the proximity and in direct association with the leptomeninges, suggesting leptomeningeal involvement in functional adaptive immune responses (Figures S4E and S7B).
        These findings suggest that the TME is a key determinant of TLS maturation in glioma. T-low-TLS within TLStype2 gliomas failed to progress into more mature aggregates, potentially due to an inhibitory microenvironment characterized by hypoxia and subsequent necrosis. The vascular features and lymphocyte phenotypes of B: T-TLS and PC-TLS within TLStype1 gliomas and in proximity to leptomeninges underscored their ability to support more complex immune functions. The maturation of TLS was facilitated by an immune-permissive microenvironment in the TLStype1 gliomas. Functional TLS may thus allow for identifying gliomas with an immune-permissive microenvironment, which could be more amenable to immunotherapy, compared with the typically immunosuppressive glioma microenvironment.
        To assess the potential of TLS maturity as a predictive biomarker, we analyzed one of the few available molecular datasets that correlates transcriptomic profiles with immunotherapy response. (Ref: 44) After rigorous quality control, we included 18 transcriptomic profiles from longitudinal tumor resections of 10 patients prior to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. We developed a “functional TLS score” based on the expression levels of genes associated with plasma cells and dendritic cells (Figure 7F). Tumors from patients who responded to immunotherapy had higher functional TLS scores, suggesting a link between TLS maturity and treatment efficacy (Figure 7F). This is in line with findings from a previous study on association of transcriptional profiles of glioma immune microenvironment and immunotherapy response. (Ref: 31) However, due to the small patient cohorts, these findings require careful interpretation and further validation in larger datasets.
        In order to simplify the applicability of our TLS-based glioma classification for future clinical research, we designed a simple staining protocol capable of distinguishing between the three glioma subgroups: TLStype1 gliomas (orange, enriched in B: T-TLS and PC-TLS), TLStype2 gliomas (gray, enriched in T-low-TLS), and TLSnegative gliomas (black, Figure 7G). This method was based on CD20 IHC to detect TLS+ tumors, followed by multiplex staining of TLS+ tumors for CD20 (B cells), CD3 (T cells), MZB1 (plasma cells), and LAMP3 (dendritic cells). TLSs were then classified as T-low-TLS according to the following thresholds: MZB1+ cells < 3%, LAMP3+ cells < 0.25%, and CD20+/CD3+ cell ratio > 1.5 (Figure 7G). TLS+ tumors with more than 50% of TLS classified as T-low-TLS were labeled as TLStype2 gliomas, the other TLS+ tumors were labeled TLStype1 gliomas (Figure 7G). We applied this strategy to our patient cohort, classifying tumors as either TLStype1, TLStype2, or TLSnegative glioma. For the subgroup of IDH-WT gliomas, we correlated these annotations with overall patient survival (Figure 7H). Patients with TLStype1 gliomas exhibited a significant survival advantage, compared with those with TLStype2 gliomas (Figure 7H). The survival outcomes of patients with TLStype2 gliomas were comparable to those of patients with TLSnegative glioma, underscoring the importance of TLS maturity for clinical outcomes (Figure 7H).

## Discussion

      In this study, we demonstrated that 15% of adult-type diffuse gliomas harbor TLSs, which differentiated into functional immune hubs characterized by sustained adaptive immune responses associated with improved patient survival. The incidence of TLSs in glioma was lower, compared with that in other solid cancers such as breast cancer (47% TLS+), (Ref: 45) ovarian cancer (50% TLS+), (Ref: 46) melanoma (33% TLS+ primary tumors, 81% TLS+ metastatic tumors), (Ref: 47) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (90% TLS+), (Ref: 48) and lung adenocarcinoma (90% TLS+). (Ref: 49) Nevertheless, our study challenges the paradigm of glioma being a bona fide immune-cold tumor, demonstrating the existence of dynamic adaptive immune responses within certain gliomas. Importantly, patient stratification according to TLS quality had a higher prognostic value than stratification simply based on the presence of B cell aggregates. Our work delineates the cellular characteristics of functional TLS maturation in glioma and identifies TLStype1 gliomas as a glioma subtype with an immune-permissive microenvironment.
      In many solid tumors, the availability of mutated tumor-specific antigens due to high TMB values is associated with improved adaptive immune responses. (Ref: 33) In glioma, however, we found that TLS can form despite low levels of TMB, highlighting that antigen availability is not the only determinant of anti-tumor immunity. This is in line with a lack of association between TMB and immunotherapy response in gliomas. (Ref: 50)
      Comparison of TLS+ and TLS− gliomas indicated a decreased neural tumor signature in TLS+ tumors. Accordingly, increased ECM and immune cell signatures are seen in gliomas with low-neural signature, which are also associated with improved overall and progression-free survival. (Ref: 51) Furthermore, we found non-canonical collagen expression by stromal components of the TME and increased perivascular ECM remodeling in TLS+ tumors. The ECM remodeling in TLS+ tumors was accompanied by expression of ECM-remodeling enzymes and internalization of collagen components by tumor-associated macrophages. Remodeling of the blood-brain barrier ECM components by matrix metalloproteases is linked to blood-brain barrier opening, (Ref: 52) which could improve immune cell infiltration.
      Our findings delineate the cellular and molecular architecture of three qualitatively distinct TLS differentiation states identified in the TLS+ adult-type diffuse gliomas. Two intratumoral TLS subtypes, namely, B: T-TLS and PC-TLS, elicited features of dynamic adaptive immune responses, although they lacked classical germinal centers, follicular dendritic cells (CD21+, CD23+), and functional HEVs (PNAd+, MAdCAM-1+), which are found in numerous non-CNS tumors. (Ref: 14) (Ref: 15) (Ref: 16) (Ref: 18) (Ref: 25) (Ref: 26) (Ref: 53) (Ref: 54) The B: T-TLS subtype featured LAMP3+ dendritic cells that preferentially co-localized with a specific subset of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. This TLS subtype thus showed the strongest similarity to mature TLSs described in other tumor entities. (Ref: 55) Increased tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells in the presence of mature TLSs and dendritic cells is also observed in melanoma, sarcoma, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer. (Ref: 15) (Ref: 16) (Ref: 46) (Ref: 55)
      TLSs in ovarian cancer (Ref: 56) and renal cell carcinoma (Ref: 18) support the formation of IgA+ and IgG+ class-switched and affinity-matured plasma cells. For renal cell carcinoma, IgG deposition on tumor cells in TLS+ tumors is associated with improved patient survival and response to immunotherapy. (Ref: 18) We showed that glioma-associated B: T-TLS and PC-TLS were capable of producing IgA+ and IgG+ class-switched and affinity-matured plasma cells that egressed from the TLS area. TLS-associated plasma cells may therefore contribute to local tumor-specific antibody production in gliomas. Although IgG deposition was not directly assessed in our study, the presence of plasma cells within TLS raises the possibility of a localized humoral immune response. In other tumor types, intratumoral antibodies bind tumor antigens and influence the TME. (Ref: 18) (Ref: 53) (Ref: 57) (Ref: 58) (Ref: 59) Whether similar processes occur in gliomas remains to be determined.
      A smaller subset of glioma-associated TLSs (T-low-TLS subtype) was characterized by a less mature phenotype with high frequencies of CD163+ macrophages and is therefore evocative of lympho-myeloid aggregates. (Ref: 20) T-low-TLS appeared to halt their differentiation trajectory early on in the TLS maturation and consequently elicited markedly lower plasma cell-forming capacity than B: T-TLS and PC-TLS. The discontinued differentiation seems to be mediated by a less immune-permissive microenvironment, since tumors that preferentially form T-low-TLS had reduced VEGF signaling, glycolysis, and other hypoxia-related pathways, as well as extended areas of tissue necrosis. Indeed, hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1a and subsequent metabolic reprogramming regulates T cell differentiation. (Ref: 60) (Ref: 61) Our findings thus support the notion that local microenvironmental signals drive TLS maturation. Of note, T-low-TLSs were found in both IDH-WT and IDH-mut gliomas, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in their formation are independent of the IDH-mut-specific metabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate that is associated with dysfunction of macrophages and dendritic cells. (Ref: 62) (Ref: 63)
      In summary, our multi-modal study comprehensively assessed the clinical relevance of TLSs and delineated the molecular and cellular features associated with TLS maturation in adult-type diffuse glioma. The relevance of pathway-based GBM classification as opposed to lineage-based classifications has only recently been emphasized. (Ref: 64) Our study identifies a glioma subtype, TLStype1 glioma, which is associated with an immune-permissive microenvironment and improved patient survival. This subtype was characterized by an enrichment of functional glioma-associated TLSs (B: T- and PC-TLS). We propose an immunofluorescence-based screening assay for TLS-based glioma immune subtyping using pathology tissue sections, which could potentially serve as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy responsiveness. These insights are of potential relevance for a redefined patient stratification in GBM immunotherapy trials, based on the presence or absence of a functional TLS, as well as for the development of targeted therapies for induction or maturation of TLS.

### Limitations of the study

        This study establishes an association between glioma-associated TLS, improved patient survival, and an immune-permissive TME, but the precise functional role of TLS in anti-glioma immunity remains incompletely defined. In particular, the antigen specificity and effector functions of antibodies secreted by TLS-derived plasma cells were not directly assessed, and thus their contribution to tumor control remains speculative. Moreover, TLSs were detected in only ∼15% of gliomas. Although transcriptional profiling revealed molecular differences between TLS⁺ and TLS⁻ gliomas, the determinants of TLS formation remain undefined. Tumor-intrinsic features, specific antigen, local stromal composition, or microenvironmental cues may influence TLS induction, but further studies are required to define these mechanisms.

### Experimental model and study participant details

#### Sample collection and ethical approval

          Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) glioma tissue specimen were collected from the University Cancer Center (UCT) Biobank Frankfurt, Germany and classified according to WHO criteria by a board-certified neuropathologist (K. H. P) and a board-certified pathologist (P. C.). In 316 patients histopathological tumor assessment was accompanied by genome-wide DNA methylation analyzes. (Ref: 79) Clinical data and tumor samples were obtained upon informed consent of the patients. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards such as the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was endorsed by the local ethical committee (SNO-4-2022).

#### Patient selection

          In an unbiased retrospective approach, we investigated adult-type diffuse IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant gliomas deposited in the UCT BioBank from 2015 to 2022. Exclusion criteria were patients under the age of 18 years, missing FFPE-tissue blocks and stereotactic biopsies. A total of 642 adult-type diffuse glioma tissue specimens were analyzed, comprising IDH-wildtype (n = 452) and IDH-mutant (n = 190) cases. See also Figure 1A and Table S1.

#### Clinical data and analysis

          Clinical data were obtained through retrospective review of medical records, including radiological records, surgical notes and pathology reports, as well as the UCT Tumor Documentation. Tumor location was assigned based on preoperative imaging studies and intraoperative findings. Tumor recurrence was defined based on histological evidence from subsequent biopsies, with the criterion that the interval between the first and second biopsy was at least three months. IDH R132H IHC (clone H09, 1:50, Dianova, Germany) results were used to determine the presence of IDH mutation. Patients aged 55 years and older were classified as IDH wildtype if IHC staining was negative. In the case of IDH R132H IHC negativity in patients younger than 55 years, we considered the results of methylome analysis which was used to detect rarer IDH mutations based on WHO criteria. (Ref: 4) The results of methylation subclassification of gliomas were accessed using the Heidelberg classification platform (v11b4). This classifier employs machine learning algorithms trained on a comprehensive database of DNA methylation profiles from glioma specimens, allowing classification into methylation subclasses. (Ref: 79) Proximity to meninges was determined by the visibility of meninges in histopathology (n = 103 TLS+, n = 110 TLS), and on the presence of meningeal enhancement in post-contrast T1-weighted MRI sequences (n = 76 TLS+, n = 50 TLS). Overall survival analysis was performed using the R survival package (Ref: 80) functions for multinomial cox proportional hazards regression and survminer package to generate Kaplan-Maier curves. (Ref: 81) Survival was right censored and the day of last clinical follow up was used for patients that were alive or had an unknown day of death.

### Method details

#### IHC and screening for B-cell aggregation

          FFPE tissue blocks of 642 glioma specimens were collected and classified according to WHO criteria by board-certified neuropathologists. A representative block of each specimen was selected for immunohistochemistry staining. 3 μm tissue sections were cut (Leica SM2000R microtome, Germany) and mounted onto glass slides (Superfrost Plus, ThermoFisher Scientific, Germany) for IHC staining. IHC staining against CD20 antigen (clone L26, 1:500 dilution; DAKO, Denmark) was performed using standard protocols for the Leica SM2000R automated stainer. For B cell aggregation assessment, CD20-stained glioma specimens were screened using light microscopy and whole slide image analysis. Samples with sparse and non-clustered B cells were classified as containing no immune aggregation, while those containing clusters of CD20+ cells were classified as containing immune aggregates. Samples containing B cell aggregates were then scanned using the Vectra Polaris (Akoya Biosciences, United States) slide scanner and digital image analysis was performed using HALO software (Indica Labs, United States). Immune cell aggregates consisting of >50 B cells were classified as TLS. (Ref: 25) (Ref: 32) The pathological assessment and validation of TLS was performed by board-certified pathologists (P. C.) and neuropathologists (K. H. P.). Additionally, CD20-stained brightfield (BF) sections were used to measure necrotic areas within the tumors. A comparison of necrotic area proportions was conducted between TLStype2 and TLStype1 gliomas.
          To determine whether the TLS+ glioma samples contained functional HEVs, double IHC chromogenic staining was performed using CD20 and PNAd (n = 28), or CD20 and MAdCAM-1 (n = 29). Detection was carried out using the Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection and Bond Polymer Refine Detection (Leica). Tonsil and intestine tissues were used as positive controls.

#### Multiplex immunofluorescence staining and digital image analysis

          Sections of gliomas comprising B cell aggregates of at least 50 cells were stained using the Opal Polaris 7-color manual detection kit (#NEL861001KT, Akoya Biosciences), based on the tyramide signal amplification immunostaining (TSA) technique. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed on a LabSat® research automated staining device (Lunaphore Technologies SA, Switzerland), with an antibody panel targeting human CD20, CD3, CD163, lysosomal associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Table S2). For nuclei detection, 10⨯ Spectral DAPI (4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, SKU FP1490, Akoya Biosciences) was used. 7-plex stainings were acquired at 0.5 μm/pixel on the Vectra Polaris™ Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System (Akoya Biosciences) using MOTiF technology. Subsequently, whole slide multispectral image analysis was performed using (i) PhenoChart Whole Slide Viewer (Akoya Biosciences) (ii) InForm® image analysis software (Akoya Biosciences) for spectral unmixing and batch analysis, and (iii) HALO® image analysis software (Indica Labs., United States) for fusing unmixed batched images and downstream analysis. Whole slide quantification was conducted to evaluate the spatial arrangement of CD3+ (T cells) and CD20+ (B cells) populations within the glioma microenvironment. The proximity between CD3+ and CD20+ cells was assessed using a predefined parameter: CD3+ cells located within 50 μm of CD20+ cells. Density heatmaps were generated for CD3+ and CD20+ cells using a radius of 25 μm. Descriptive statistics in R were used to summarize the spatial distribution data of B and T cells.
          For TLS subtyping in Figure 7, a separate panel of antibodies targeting CD20, CD3, CD163, LAMP3, MZB1, and vWF was used to identify and quantify immune cell populations (B cells, T cells, plasma cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells) within each TLS structure. Based on cell quantification results, a custom R code was developed for TLS subtyping. TLS were classified as T-low-TLS according to the following thresholds: MZB1+ cells < 3%, LAMP3+ cells < 0.25%, CD20+/CD3+ cell ratio > 1.5. Twelve TLS structures with known subtypes derived from spatial transcriptomics data were used to establish cutoffs for the classification. TLS+ tumors with more than 50% of TLS classified as T-low-TLS are labeled as TLStype 2 gliomas, the other TLS+ tumors are labeled TLStype 1 gliomas.

#### Whole exome sequencing and analysis

##### Experimental process

            Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 41 samples, inclusive of TLS+ (n = 21) and TLS (n = 20) samples. DNA was extracted from FFPE glioblastoma tissue samples using the Maxwell RSC FFPE Plus DNA kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). The concentration of DNA was determined using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific). WES libraries were generated from 750 ng DNA, using the Illumina DNA Prep with Enrichment Kit (Illumina). In brief, genomic DNA was tagmented, cleaned-up and amplified. Clean-ups were performed with AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter) at a 1.8× volume ratio. The cleaned-up libraries were then pooled, hybridized with probes and subsequently amplified. The WES libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 1000 platform using NextSeq1000 2 × 100 bp flow cells.

##### Data analysis

            Base calls generated by the Illumina Realtime Analysis software were converted into BAM and vcf files using the DRAGEN somatic pipeline on Illumina BaseSpace (Illumina, v3.9.5). The quality control, adapter trimming, and read-level filtering were performed on the DRAGEN Somatic app using the default settings. Sequencing data was aligned to GRCh38/hg38 genome and the tumor mutational burden (TMB) values were calculated within the application. TMB values were imported into R for further statistical analysis. Samples were classified as “TMB-high” when mutation count is greater or equal to 10 per megabase (Ref: 82) and “hypermutation” when TMB is ≥ 17 mutations/Mb. (Ref: 83)

#### Bulk RNA-sequencing and analysis

##### Experimental process

            64 gliomas with and without TLS, matched for IDH mutational status, age, and sex, were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from 10 ⨯ 10 μm FFPE tissue sections using the Maxwell RSC FFPE RNA kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual (Promega, United States). RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer using the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, United States). The RNA quality was assessed by the TapeStation system 4150 with the High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, United States). RNA libraries were generated from 200 ng RNA using the Illumina total RNA Prep Ligation with Ribo-Zero Plus kit (Illumina, United States). In brief, RNA was depleted of rRNA, followed by fragmentation, cDNA generation, library clean-up and amplification. Clean-ups were performed with AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter, United States) with a 1.8× volume ratio. The cleaned-up libraries were then pooled, hybridized with probes, and amplified. The RNA libraries were sequenced in 100 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NextSeq 1000 sequencer with NextSeq1000 P2 200 cycles flow cells.

##### Data analysis

            Alignment, normalization, and quantification of reads were performed using DRAGEN RNA pipeline (v 4.0.4, Illumina). Human genome version 38 (alt-masked v3, graph enabled) was used as alignment reference. The normalized count matrix was combined with metadata, such as clinical data and run information, in a SummarizedExperiment object. This object was imported into R for downstream analysis. Long non-coding RNA and pseudogenes were filtered and removed. A total of 21,651 genes were retained for further analysis. Differential gene expression was computed using the R package DESeq2. (Ref: 65) The differential gene expression model used for DESeq2 included several variables: TLS status, IDH mutational status, sex, batch. Genes with adjusted p-values (padj) less than 0.05 were regarded as significantly differentially expressed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using ReactomePA R package (v 1.9.4). (Ref: 66) Pathways with padj values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
            Cellular deconvolution was performed using SpatialDecon R package (Ref: 35) (v 1.12.3) with a single-cell data reference derived from glioma. A custom signature matrix was created to decipher the types of cells present, and this was performed by applying a background noise level of 0.1 to estimate cellular proportions within the two groups (tumors with and without TLS). The matrix was created using a single-cell dataset from glioma, known as CoreGB map (Ref: 34), which contains 338,564 cells from 16 datasets encompassing over 100 glioblastoma patients. This reference was also used to highlight cell-type specific gene expression. While the CoreGB map provides detailed annotations for all cell types, we focused on finer annotation levels for specific cell types that are prominent within TLS, including B cells, T cells, NK cells, mural cells, endothelial cells, plasma cells, and fibroblasts. For other cell types, including those within the ‘glial-neuronal lineage’, ‘differentiated-like lineage’, ‘stem-like lineage’, and ‘myeloid lineage’, broader annotation groups were retained. This approach was used to enhance the identification of marker genes for the prominent cell types within TLS. The statistical tests were performed using the Wilcoxon test between the different cell type proportions within each sample using the rstatix (R package v0.7.2). R software (version 4.3) was used to perform all data analysis.

#### Spatial transcriptomics with GeoMx® DSP

##### Experimental process

            FFPE tissue sections (5 μm), taken consecutively from the same blocks that underwent high-plex immunofluorescence, were placed onto microscope slides and the GeoMx® Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas Assay (NanoString Technologies) was conducted following the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, slides were baked for 2 h for paraffin removal, followed by deparaffinisation and rehydration of tissue sections. Antigen retrieval (Tris-EDTA buffer for 15 mins at 100°C) and proteinase K treatment (1 mg/mL for 15 min at 37°C) were subsequently performed. Tissues sections were then hybridized with the human Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) probes overnight at 37°C. After two stringent washes (4 ⨯ SSC buffer with formamide at 1:1 ratio) at 37°C for 5 min, the slides were blocked and incubated with morphology marker antibodies: CD20 (50-0202-82, Invitrogen), CD3 (NBP2-54405AF532, Novus Biologicals), CD138 (352324, BioLegend). For nuclei detection, SYTO82™ Orange Fluorescent Nucleic Acid Stain (S11363, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. The oligo-barcodes are attached to the fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization probes via a photocleavable linker. Tissue sections were loaded into the GeoMx® DSP platform, where the region of interest (ROI) could be selected using the morphology markers. CD20 was used to identify the lymphoid aggregates and regions outside the TLS (tumor area) were selected as control. Due to the size limitation in ROI selection (maximum 660 × 785 μm), multiple ROIs were selected for TLS with bigger region size. Upon the ROI selection, UV light was shined onto the sample by the GeoMx® DSP, releasing the oligo-barcodes for collection and sequencing preparation. Oligonucleotide tags were added with Illumina i5 and i7 dual indexing primers to uniquely index each sample and cleaned up using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). For library concentration measurement and quality assessment, a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a TapeStation 4150 System (Agilent Technologies) were used respectively. Sequencing was performed on an NextSeq 1000 (Illumina) and the GeoMx® NGS Pipeline (v2.0.21) on the Illumina BaseSpace Sequence Hub was used for demultiplexing. A total of 137,308,894 transcripts was generated across 64,638 nuclei, corresponding to an average of 2124.27 transcripts per nucleus.

##### Data analysis

            Raw counts from four separate experimental runs were combined into a single dataset. All further analysis was performed with R version 4.3. The initial processing of raw gene expression count files was conducted utilizing R packages including NanoStringNCTools, (Ref: 68) GeomxTools, (Ref: 69) and GeoMxWorkflows. (Ref: 70) The quality control parameters used in the analysis were as follows: a minimum of 1,000 reads per segment, 80% trimmed reads, 80% stitched reads, 75% aligned reads, 50% sequencing saturation, a minimum of 1 negative control count, a maximum of 9,000 counts in the NTC well, a minimum of 20 estimated nuclei, and a minimum area of 1,000 units. A default value of 2.0 was used as threshold for limit of quantification (LOQ) to eliminate gene segments exhibiting poor signal i. e, if a gene has twice the expression level of the negative probes, it is detected with high confidence. Subsequently, integration of data from biological runs with clinical patient data was performed to generate a SummarisedExperiment object. Normalization of the expression profiles across different runs was accomplished through quantile normalization, followed by the implementation of the limma package (Ref: 84) to mitigate batch effects. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were subsequently conducted on the spatial data. Clustering was performed using k-means method (k = 3) implemented in the ClusterR package. (Ref: 72) (Ref: 85) Marker genes for each cluster were determined using the scoreMarker function of the scater package. (Ref: 73) Similar to the bulk RNA-sequencing data, SpatialDecon (Ref: 35) was employed for cell type deconvolution using the previously mentioned signature matrix. However, background noise value (at 0.01) and nuclei counts obtained from GeoMx DSP were used to determine the cellular compositions within the three TLS clusters. The background noise values were used in accordance with the recommendations in the package manual.

#### High-plex spatial proteomics & image analysis

          The COMET™ spatial proteome profiler (Lunaphore Technologies SA) was employed for highplex immunofluorescence staining and imaging for the detection of 31 markers within a single tissue sample. Nine TLS+ Glioma FFPE sections (3 μm) were generated using the Leica SM 2000R microtome (Leica Microsystems), and incubated at 37°C overnight. Prior to staining, FFPE sections were processed for deparaffinization, rehydration and epitope retrieval using Epredia Dewax and HIER buffer at pH 9 (Lunaphore Technologies SA) and PT Module™ (Epredia), for 60 min at 102°C. 31-plex sequential immunofluorescence (IF) stainings and digital imaging were performed on the COMET™ platform using an antibody panel for the detection of the following markers: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD68, CD74, CD163, CXCR5, CXCL13, αSMA, vWF, ICOS, IL-10, IL-35, IgA, IgG, Ki67, MZB1, LAMP3, PD-1, PD-L1, FoxP3, granzyme B (GrB), GAP43 or GFAP, Col4, Col6A1, decorin (DCN), vimentin (VIM), neurofilament (NF) (Table S2). Additionally, FFPE sections of tonsils and post-mortem adult human brains without neurological disorders were used as controls. The control tissues were kindly provided by the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Frankfurt, with a postmortem delay of 7-24 hr. A mixture of Alexa Fluor Plus 555- (1:100, #32732 or #32727, ThermoFisher Scientific) and 647-conjugated (1:200, #32733 or #32728, ThermoFisher Scientific) anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies was applied with DAPI nuclear stain (4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 1:500, #62248, ThermoFisher Scientific). All reagents were prepared in multistaining buffer (BU06, Lunaphore Technologies SA). Multiple, sequential cycles of double-IF stainings and single-channel imaging were followed by the chemical elution of primary and secondary antibodies using an elution buffer (BU07-L, Lunaphore Technologies). Autofluorescence was reduced both, chemically by applying the Quenching buffer (BU08-L, Lunaphore Technologies) and digitally, by software-based background subtraction (HORIZON™, Lunaphore Technologies). TIFF output images was performed using the HALO® image analysis platform (Indica Lab).
          R Statistical Software v4.3 was used for statistical analysis and displaying results. For this, the results from cell segmentation (x-y coordinates of each cell object and marker expression) were exported from HALO. Cellular phenotypes were determined according to Table S5. For each cell, we calculated the mean distance over the distances to the three nearest B cells. Cells for which this distance was <600 μm were considered inside TLS, since this allows us to segregate between cells that are located within and close to B cell aggregates.

#### Spatial single-cell transcriptomics (Xenium)

##### Experimental process

            FFPE tissue sections (5 μm), taken consecutively following high-plex immunofluorescence, were placed onto Xenium slide with a 12 mm ⨯ 24 mm imageable area and a 235 mm2 sample area (10.5 mm ⨯ 22.45 mm). Prepared tissue sections were then deparaffinised and decrosslinked prior to probe hybridisation, following the manufacturers protocol. Probe hybridisation was performed overnight with the custom pre-designed panel, targeting 468 genes that are shown in the Table S3. Following probe hybridisation and ligation of the probe ends, an enzymatic rolling circle amplification was used to generate multiple copies of the gene-specific barcode for each RNA target. Multimodal Tissue Segmentation Kit (10x Genomics) was used to stain the tissue with interior, nuclear and membrane stains. This kit uses DAPI for nuclear staining, s18 RNA for cytoplasmic staining, and antibodies against CD45, ATPase Na+/K+ Transporting Subunit Alpha 1 (AP1A1) and E-cadherin for cell membrane staining. Data acquisition was conducted with the Xenium Analyzer (Instrument software version 3.0.2.0, analysis version Xenium-3.0.0.15; 10x Genomics), generating transcript-by-cell and transcript-by-location matrices. Following Xenium data acquisition, tissue sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) following the manufacturer’s protocol, for quality control of tissue image analysis results.

##### Data analysis

            Xenium data for each sample were imported using the readXenium function from the Voyager package. (Ref: 74) For each sample, only cells with a total transcript count greater than zero (i. e. non-empty cells) and a nuclear area less than 400 units were retained. Negative control features were removed. The remaining samples were combined into a SpatialFeatureExperiment object. TLS regions in the Xenium data were identified and manually labeled based on MS4A1 gene expression using Xenium Explorer. Cell IDs from cells within TLS were extracted and were used to subset the SpatialFeatureExperiment object to TLS regions only. Leiden clustering of transcriptome profiles for cell type annotation was performed on cells from TLS regions only. Marker genes for each cluster were extracted using the scoreMarker function of the scater package. (Ref: 73) Cell types were manually annotated based on marker gene expression. TLSs were categorized into three subtypes based on cellular composition.
            The B cell differentiation score was calculated as follows: differentiation_score = CR2 + CD27 + JCHAIN + MZB1 + XBP1 + CD38 - IGHD - TCL1A. The gene names in this formula stand for the normalized expression values of the respective genes.
            For subclustering of the T cell population, transcriptomic profiles were restricted to a subset of T cell-related genes and Leiden clustering was applied. The selection of T cell-related genes was necessary to prevent clustering driven by contaminating transcripts from neighbouring cells. The following genes were used in this analysis: ANXA1, B2M, BCL2, BCL6, CALM1, CASP8, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CD2, CD27, CD274, CD28, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD4, CD44, CD47, CD48, CD52, CD8A, CD8B, COL5A1, CSF2RB, CTLA4, CXCR4, EOMES, FASLG, FOXP3, GNLY, GPR183, GZMA, GZMB, GZMK, HAVCR2, HOPX, ICOS, IFNG, IL1R1, IL32, IL7R, ITGAL, ITGB1, ITM2A, KLRB1, KLRD1, LAG3, LTB, MKI67, NKG7, NR4A2, PDCD1, PTPRC, RGCC, S100A4, STAT3, STAT4, TCF7, TSHZ2, TXK, VIM. Cell-to-cell communication analysis among various cell types was analyzed using the CellPhoneDB package, (Ref: 75) and the results were plotted with ktplots. (Ref: 76)

#### Immunoglobulin sequencing

          For sequencing of the immunoglobulin heavy chain transcript repertoires from bulk tumor tissue, cryopreserved tissue blocks obtained from the UCT Biobank were sectioned to isolate 100 μm tissue in total (10 x 10 μm sections). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer protocol. cDNA synthesis and amplification of immunoglobulin heavy chain cDNA was performed using the SMART-Seq Human BCR (with UMIs) kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer protocol. The amplicons were subjected to library preparation using the Ligation Sequencing Kit V14 then sequenced on MinION flow cells R10.4.1 according to the manufacturer protocol (both from Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Basecalling was performed using dorado (ONT) and reads were filtered according to a minimum sequencing quality threshold of Q20. A custom workflow combining different tools of the immcantation suite (Ref: 77) was then used to assign UMIs and V(D)J sequence features for each read. The clonal lineage trees were constructed using Dowser. (Ref: 78)

### Quantification and statistical analysis

        Statistical analyses and visualization were conducted using R (v4.3) with significance defined as p-values < 0.05, unless indicated otherwise. A multinomial Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied in Figures 1D and S1L. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for: pairwise comparisons among T-low-TLS, B: T-TLS, and PC-TLSs (Figures 3C, 3D, 3F, 3G, 4B, 4C, S5A, S5B, and S6D–S6E); TLS+ vs. TLS (Figures 2B, S1M, S2and S5C); TLStype1, TLStype2, and TLS groups (Figures 7C–7E); and TLS with/without LM contact (Figure S1D). DESeq2 was used to test for differential gene expression between TLS+ and TLS gliomas (Figures S2C and S2E). ANOVA was used to compare T-low-TLS, B: T-TLS, and PC-TLSs (Figures 4F, 4G, 4I–4K). Fisher’s exact test compared TLS+ vs. TLS (Figure S1E), TLS+ with vs. without LM contact vs. no TLS (Figure S1G), and TLStype1 vs. TLStype2 (Figure S7B). Receptor–ligand cell–cell specificity significance was calculated by comparing the proportion of means greater than or equal to the observed mean using the CellPhoneDB package (Ref: 75) (Figure 6B). Kaplan–Meier survival curves were assessed with log-rank tests (Figure 7H). Kruskal–Wallis tests with Dunn’s test were used for TLS subtype comparisons (Figure S6C).

Clinical information for the sections analyzed in the study, related to Figure 1The table presents clinical data for the 642 tumor specimens analyzed, providing detailed information on each specimen and patient. It includes the patient’s sex, whether the specimen was derived from primary or recurrent tumor, tumor localization, TLS classification (TLS or non-TLS), IDH status, methylation class, methylation subclass, age at diagnosis (in days), and survival data. Survival data is specified in days and includes the patient's survival status (0 = censored, 1 = deceased). For survival calculations, if the survival status is 1, the time difference between diagnosis and death is used; if the survival status is 0, the time difference between diagnosis and the last visit is used. Similarly, for progression-free survival, if progression is detected (status = 1), the time difference between diagnosis and progression is calculated; otherwise, the time to the last visit is calculated. Since some patients have both primary and recurrent sections, clinical data may appear twice for these individuals. Overall survival and progression-free survival analyzes were conducted using primary sections only. File (11.70 KB)Table S3.

Marker combinations used to define cell phenotypes in 31-plex immunofluorescence data, related to Figures 4 and 5This table indicates which marker combinations were used to define cellular phenotypes in 31-plex immunofluorescence data. Each row represents one cellular phenotype – the phenotype name is indicated in the first column “phenotype”. The other columns indicate the usage of specific markers for phenotype definition: “1” = cells need to be positive for this marker, “-1” = cells need to be negative for this marker in order to be labeled with the corresponding phenotype. “0” = the marker was not used to define the phenotype. One segmented cell object can have multiple phenotypes. For each immune cell population (CD4+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, plasma cells, CD8+ T cells, CD163+ macrophages and LAMP3+ dendritic cells) the phenotype with suffix “total” comprises all cells of the population. The phenotypes are defined such, that the number of cells in the “total” population corresponds exactly to the sum of cells in the subpopulations. For plasma cells for example: PC_total = (PC_CD38+MZB1+IgG+) + (PC_CD38+MZB1+IgA+) + (PC_other). The subpopulations with suffix “_extra” represent more specific marker profiles and overlap with other subpopulations. PDF (40.01 MB)Document S2. Article plus supplemental information

(C) Pathway score for Reactome pathway: M-Phase (R-HSA-68886), glycolysis (R-HSA-70171), cellular response to hypoxia (R-HSA-1234174), and VEGF signaling (R-HSA-194138) in TLStype1 (orange), TLStype2 (gray), and TLSnegative gliomas (black).

(D) Ki67 proliferation scores in TLStype2 and TLStype1 gliomas (immunohistochemical measurement).

(E) Percentage of necrotic tumor area in TLStype2 and TLStype1 gliomas. See also Figure S7 for an example of necrotic area calculation. p value in (C–E) were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

(F) Transcriptomic score for functional TLS, calculated from 18 tumor samples across 10 patients who underwent anti-PD1 treatment. (Ref: 44) The score was computed as the sum of normalized and scaled expression values of functional TLS marker genes. Upper: normalized and scaled gene expression levels in each sample. Lower: functional TLS score used to rank samples. Bar color indicates clinical response to anti-PD1 (as defined in original study). x axis labels show patient ID (also used for color coding) and time point of surgery during which the sample was collected (in days before therapy initiation).

(G) Screening workflow for identification of TLS+ tumors and tumor stratification into TLStype1 (orange), TLStype2 (gray), and TLSnegative gliomas (black).

(H) Overall survival analysis of patients with different IDH-WT glioma subtypes: TLStype1 (orange), TLStype2 (gray), and TLSnegative glioma (black). p values for survival comparisons were calculated by log-rank test for pairwise group comparisons, and their values are for comparisons: TLSnegative vs. TLStype2 glioma (p = 0.77), TLSnegative vs. TLStype1 glioma (p = 0.018), and TLStype2 vs. TLStype1 glioma (p = 0.016).
